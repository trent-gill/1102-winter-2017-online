#####Reader Response Blog Posts and Commenting*  

----

**Due Dates:**  

The two Reading Responses are due at different times in the semester--one in the first half of the semester and one in the second half of the semester. Each Response, or post, is graded out of ten (10). The due dates are determined by your group assignment; these due dates are not flexible, and late submissions are not allowed. Make sure you know what group you are in, and what the due dates are for that group. **Email me immediately if there's an issue.** 

Reading Responses must be posted no later than 5pm on Wednesdays. We will begin posting on **January 18th**.  Prompts for the Reader Responses will be available to the group with that week's deadline no later than the Monday before the Wednesday you're due to post. Comments--from everyone in the class--are due not later than the Friday after the Wednesday posting, at 5pm. Take note of the time deadlines and schedule yourself accordingly. 

Here's the schedule broken down: 

| Day of the Week (and Time) | What will happen / What is due |
|:------------ |:--------------- |
| Monday | Prompt will arrive for the week's Reader Response Post (only applies to those who have a post due). Check your group page or your Blackboard Email. |
| Wednesday, 5pm | Reader Response Post is due. Responses must be posted to the relevant Blackboard blog and be available to the class by 5pm. Draft postings do not count. |
| Friday, 5pm | Comments are due on at least one Reader Response Post by a classmate. If you have not logged a comment by this time, you cannot receive credit for that week. |

**Warning: Remember, there are no extensions or late posts / comments allowed. You miss the deadlines for posting and/or commenting, you get zero.**

**Explanations:** Each week there will be 5-7 students in a group who will each individually complete a Reader Response Blog Post to lead the class discussion and direction for the upcoming class module. Each Reader Response Post should be **a minimum 500 word response** to the prompt I deliver (see schedule above). Ideally, we'll end up with 5-7 unique approaches to the text under discussion that respond to the prompt and lead to interesting comments from classmates. 

Groups can respond together by taking a group approach to the prompt, but each individual must respond with a minimum 500-word response. There are no "team responses" or group posts allowed. I encourage you to discuss approaches, definitions, and parameters with members of your group, but you must post a Reader Response of your own that meets the minimum requirements to receive credit. 

**General Expectations for Reader Response Blog Posts and Commenting:** Expectations for completing Reader Response Blog Posts and commenting upon them are the same as they would be for essays minus the formatting requirements. Suffice to say, all the writing, comprehension, and critical thinking skills required for essays and exams will be needed to be successful in the Reader Response Blog Posts and commenting upon them. In particular, you should use literary terminology and an informed tone avoiding excessive informality. You should imagine the audience for the post to be someone you admire and whose opinion you respect. 

**General Approach for Reader Response Blog Posts:**

Lead discussion of the texts and/or concepts of a week's module by responding to the prompt delivered by me and outlining a context for our discussion--some interesting facet or application or connection or interpretation of the assigned text(s) and/or related text. You will post your Reader Response as noted above to the course blog in Blackboard that corresponds to the text under discussion. You will also monitor the comments connected to your post from your classmates, responding to the comments as warranted. 

**General Expectations:**

Reader Response Blog Posts are not an opportunity for you to figure out what *I* might want to discuss or what *I* want to hear from you or to decipher *my* opinion on the topic or text at hand. Instead, think of the Reader Responses as an opportunity for *you* to shape how *we* approach a topic or text. The Reader Response Blog Posts are *your* chance to make the class relevant to *your* interests and to guide *your* learning in a way that suits *your* needs and interests. The Reader Response Blog Posts are **not** about writing for an instructor--they're about giving you the chance to participate fully in how you experience learning in this course, or the particular course module. Recording your frustrations is also part of the process in completing Reader Response Blog Posts. You should feel free to record your frustrations, successes, highlights, and lowlights. Everything is valid as long as it is thoughtful. You should absolutely avoid writing as if you are reaching for a grade. You are trying to be thoughtful and learn something, not "write for a C."

**Commenting on Reader Response Blog Posts (10% of your final grade):**

**General Task for Commenting:** Each week, write a **minimum 150 word comment** on **one** Reader Response of interest to you. You should feel free to write more than one comment or write a comment on more than one post, but I will count *only* the first comment and that first comment must meet the minimum word requirement. After that, you are free to comment as often, or as little, and to whatever length you wish.  You should read **all** the Reader Response Blog Posts and comment most fully on the one you think most interesting. Avoid commenting on the first one you see; **your classmates are graded, in part, on the discussion their post generates.** 

**General Expectations for Commenting:** Your comment should reflect some engagement with what the Reader Response Blog Post addresses. You might want to qualify something you noted in the Response, ask for clarification, or offer your own example affirming the Reader Response position. You should avoid "assessing" the Reader Response. While it is important to reinforce the effort of others, try not to spend most of your comment speaking to how "good" the post is--engage with the subject matter. Think of your comment as a contribution for ongoing discussion and debate. If your comment generates further discussion, you should follow up and continue that dialogue where warranted.

**General Grading Rubric for Reader Response Blog Posts:**

- *10/10*: The content and delivery exceed expectations of the prompt, and exceed the 500 word minimum. The post demonstrates a highly proficient, even memorable knowledge of the course material, and includes other media, creative interpretations, and tertiary materials. The post sparks significant discussion.
- *9-8/10*: The content and delivery exceed expectations of the prompt, including the 500 word minimum. The post demonstrates a proficient knowledge and application of the course material, and includes other media and other relevant materials. The post sparks significant discussion.
- *6-7/10*: The content and delivery meet expectations of the prompt, including the 500 word minimum. The post demonstrates accepted knowledge of the course material, but little in the way of application. The post complies with the minimum expectations for the prompt. The post sparks some discussion.
- *5-6/10*: The content and delivery meet some expectations of the prompt, but did not meet the 500 word minimum or do not demonstrate knowledge or development of the course content. The post demonstrates accepted knowledge of the course material but sparks little to no discussion. As well, there may be significant language issues.  
- *0-4/10*: The content and delivery do not meet any expectations of the prompt. The post does not demonstrate knowledge of the course material, and does not spark discussion. As well, there may be significant language issues. The post was late or incomplete--did not meet minimum word count. 

**Grading for Commenting On Reader Response Blog Posts:**

- If the single comment meets the 150-word minimum and is contributed before the Monday 5pm deadline, you get one mark. If there's no comment by Friday at 5pm, you get no mark.
