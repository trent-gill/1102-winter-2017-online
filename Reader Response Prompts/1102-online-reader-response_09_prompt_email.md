Reader Response Blog Post Prompt #9 - Apple (Group #4) 
*The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage*  
Due: March 22, 2017 - No later than 5pm - Blackboard Blog  

---

**Instructions:**

Instructions: Write a Class Lead Module of not less than 500 words that constructs a Facebook profile for *either* Ada Lovelace or Charles Babbage. You should keep in mind the themes at work the novel, and the character descriptions--and assorted adventures these characters go on--as you construct the profile. At the very least you should have a fairly comprehensive list of likes, interests, statuses, and some sample entries--links, pictures, blog posts, etc.--from their timeline. The point of this exercise is to interrogate how we understand themes--either modified, expected, or manipulated--through the representation of Lovelace and Babbage in *The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage*.

What You'll Need To Do To Pull This Off Successfully: 

- Think carefully about how you construct your own social media profile and how those decisions might transfer onto a profile for Lovelace and Babbage
- Think carefully about how Lovelace and Babbage are symbolic of a theme: what theme? How is the character symbolic of that theme--name the specific gestures / representations / actions evidenced in the text. 
- Do a quick scan of the general social / cultural conventions that shaped the [Victorian Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victorian_era) and how those conventions might influence how you make choices in the timeline and profile
- Think about what themes might inform your choices, particularly interesting themes common to genres such as [steampunk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steampunk) and [cyberpunk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberpunk) and [retrofuturism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrofuturism) 
- How do the genres above offer a continuum between the themes of the other novels and poetry and film we have looked at and *The Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage*? For instance, what similarities might there be between Wade Watt's profile and Lovelace or Babbage's profiles? 
- Be unafraid of what you don't know and think about how your post relates to the text.
