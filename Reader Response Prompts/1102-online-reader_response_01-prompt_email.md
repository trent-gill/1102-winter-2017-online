Reader Response Blog Post Prompt #1 - Google (Group #1)  
*Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore*  
Due: Jan. 18, 2017 - No later than 5pm - Blackboard Blog  

**Note**: Some of your may wish to review the [tutorial](http://digitalcultureslab.ca/douglascollege-online1102/winter2017/tutorials/) and the [general instructions](http://digitalcultureslab.ca/douglascollege-online1102/winter2017/reader-response-blog-posts/) before you begin.

**Instructions:**

There are two parts to this prompt. Write a Reader Response Blog Post that 1) briefly--in a sentence or two--explains what you think *Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore* is about ; and 2) elaborates more fully to explain how *Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore* makes a statement about **one** of the following topics: technology, reading, knowledge, friendship, the power of books, or the corporatization of knowledge?

**Some Directions:** 

- Do [the reading](http://digitalcultureslab.ca/douglascollege-online1102/winter2017/course-schedule-and-readings-full/) for this week's module, especially all those literary terms.
- Don't speak to everything in the list of topics above. Narrow your focus to one topic or even a sub-topic of the topics above. Key in on a particular scene and how it works, or what a character represents, or how the novel speaks to something specific, such as the skill of computer coding. You can be general, but rein yourself in a bit and speak to specifics. Then, reflect on how those specifics represent something significant to the novel as a whole.
- Remember to relax and write about what you think is worth talking about. I'm not looking for a right answer from you; I am looking for you to engage with the meaning of the novel *as you see it* taking into account some of the things we have learned so far about literary terminology and its role in interpretation. 

**Some Provocations:** 
 
- What do you think the book is about? Certainly, technology figures heavily in the novel, but how do you think the book judges technology? If the book is about relationships, what what judgment does the novel make about the nature of relationships? And so on.
- There are lots of references to computers, software, tech companies, etc., in the novel. How do things work out for technology in the end? What might this mean? 
- Think about where knowledge is found in the story. What might this say about how we access knowledge, what we need to do in order to get it, and what we do with it when we get it?
- Think about how the novel alludes to other representations of friendship in cultural production. Can you think of other stories that feature a group of friends on a nobel search for something (Robin Hood and the Merry Men, *Lord of the Rings*, Odysseus' crew, *The Avengers*, *Mission Impossible* Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak)? How does the novel use our expectations for such friendships to make meaning? 
- Ultimately, how does the book judge the effectiveness of technology at solving problems? We begin and the bookstore. Where does the novel end?
- What does the novel say about the act of "reading"? How does it represent "reading"? What does it tell us about *how* we should read? Or, *what* we should read?
- Keep your audience in mind: what kind of symbols are readers expecting in *Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore*? How do these symbols fit with--or diverge from--those expectations? Why do they do that? What's the point?
