**Instructions:**

Reflect on the theme of consumption and its representation in *JPod*. 

**Some Directions:** 

- Do [the reading](http://digitalcultureslab.ca/douglascollege-online1102/winter2017/course-schedule-and-readings-full/) for this week's module, especially the definition of theme.
- Your Reader Response should reflect upon specifics in *JPod* the signal consumption. This needn't always be food, but could be other things: cigarettes, sex, anonymity. In short, look for how the theme of consumption ties in with things--actual symbols that might represent consumption--not just the act of consuming.
- Remember not to generalize, but rather key in on a particular scene and explain how consumption is represented and the significance of that representation on our reading, understanding, or interpretation of the text. 
- Remember to relax and write about what you think is worth talking about. I'm not looking for a right answer from you; I am looking for you to engage with the meaning of the novel *as you see it* taking into account some of the things we have learned so far about literary terminology and its role in interpretation. 

**Some Provocations:** 
 
- Think about how consumption is important for understanding—or imagining—things you think are central to—or absent from—*JPod*.
- How does the text present consumption? (advertisements, close-ups, numbers, sequences) 
- Understand how consumptions works as a metaphor. What are the *different ways* consumption is represented in the text as the narrative unfolds? In others words, look for patterns of representation and track the changes to see how the text makes meaning. 
- Make sure you include some defining features for consumption--what does it look like? Why does it look that way? 
- Point to a specific moment in the novel where consumption distorts, reveals, or clouds  our expectations for a character, setting, symbol--what is the effect?
- Keep your audience in mind: what kind of consumption are readers expecting in *JPod*? Are we expecting consumption at all? Why would Coupland foreground consumption as a theme in the book? What's he trying to show us about literature, culture, humanity, Western civilization, capitalism?
