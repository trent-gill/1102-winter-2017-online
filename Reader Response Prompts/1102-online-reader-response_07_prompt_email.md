**Instructions:**

Write a Reader Response Post of 500 words that outlines the basic concept for--or rules of play for--a board game based on some aspect of *Ready Player One*. You should think about how you are constructing the game in light of the symbols, ideas, or plot events of *Ready Player One*. In other words, make sure the concept for the game corresponds to features specific to *Ready Player One*. You might want to make characters into game pieces, or involve "questing," define the game based on the early era of computer technology, change the rules and look of *Monopoly* or some other game into something more relevant to *Ready Player One*, or deploy other aspects central to the plot of the novel in order to imagine a board game. Make sure you think about the purpose of the game--in other words, what do you need to do to win?

 What You'll Need To Do To Pull This Off Successfully: 

- Make sure you have read *Ready Player One* from cover to cover--to the end. 
- Think about the difference between "game" and "play"
	- Game tends to have rules, order, players, a winner / loser, repeated gaming is rewarded (you get better at it)
	- Play tends to have ad-hoc rules, anyone can join, no advantage to repeated play, unstructured
- Think about the objects you will use as pieces for the game--what materials will they be made out of? What will they be representations of and why? 
- Look up [game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game) and have a good sense of the different approaches one can take to designing a game--is the game a strategy game (think *Risk*), an intelligence game (think *Trivial Pursuit*)? 
- Think about how elements of criticism we have encountered, such as symbol, metaphor, intertextuality, might be leveraged to shape how you imagine the game, particularly clich√©s of digital culture
- Imagine how the act of reading might be represented in a board game--how does your game do this?
- Think about how games often use a theme as a central device: *Risk* = war; *Monopoly* = money; "Clue" = murder
- Try to leverage already existing games to get you started: how could you use a deck of cards, or parts of a computer keyboard as a starting point?
- Be creative, daring, but keep all that you have learned in the class up until now in mind
