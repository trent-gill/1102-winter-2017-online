Reader Response Blog Post Prompt #10 - Intel (Group #5) 
*The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage*  
Due: March 29, 2017 - No later than 5pm - Blackboard Blog

**Instructions:**

Write a Reader Response Blog Post of not less than 500 words that, while focusing on a few (2 - 5) pages of *The Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage*, flips some construct of normalization; and, includes a reflection upon your decision and what that reveals about how the text makes meaning. To put this more plainly, change something about the character(s) / setting / POV / symbol(s) so that genders are the opposite of how they appear in the text (or race is opposite or setting is different or nationality is different or the perspective is different); then, tell us why you chose to "flip" what you flipped. 

As a brief example, if I chose to "flip" Kanye West's gender to female, I think that would read differently and might reveal how the theme of misogyny underlies his music and performance. (Would Kanye jump on stage to hijack Taylor Swift if he is a woman?) In your case, think about how the story / narrative / symbology would be different if the gender were flipped in *The Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage*; what would change and why?

What You'll Need To Do To Pull This Off Successfully: 

- Have a look at definitions of [gender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender) and [race](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_(human_categorization)) to make sure you know what you're "flipping"
- Think carefully about your expectations for what is "normal," particularly as it applies to the concept of [normalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalization_(sociology))--you need to trust your own expectations and examine them
- Think about how we understand "normal" and what it means to not be "normal"--how do we tell? What do we do? How do we behave? Think about how the characters in the comic would behave. Reflect upon that behaviour--what might it tell us about how the comic represents "normal"?
- It's very important to establish what you think is normal in the comic before you think about flipping things. Remember Stuart Hall--read for surfaces, make sure you are clear about those surfaces, then think of alternative readings. 
- Be unafraid of what you don't know and concentrate on making the passage you have chosen mean something.
