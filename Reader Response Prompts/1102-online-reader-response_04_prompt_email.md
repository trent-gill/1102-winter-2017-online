Reader Response Blog Post Prompt #4 - Apple (Group #4)  
*JPod*  
Due: Feb. 8, 2017 - No later than 5pm - Blackboard Blog  

**Note**: Some of your may wish to review the [tutorial](http://digitalcultureslab.ca/douglascollege-online1102/winter2017/tutorials/) and the [general instructions](http://digitalcultureslab.ca/douglascollege-online1102/winter2017/reader-response-blog-posts/) before you begin.

**Instructions:**

Instructions: Write a Reader Response Blog Post of ~500 words that maps *JPod*. The goal of this reader response is to discover how thinking about the text "geographically" influences how we receive it. For instance, there are many references to Vancouver, its surroundings, and its landmarks inform the text we are reading. By mapping such locations in *JPod*, we might see how the novel prioritizes affluent neighbourhoods over less desirable ones. Don't necessarily limit yourself to traditional geographic references. How might you map out words, themes, or binaries? How might you map patterns in language, or character traits? You might also map out popular culture references in the text, or using references in the "Living Cartoon Profiles," letters to Ronald McDonald, other epistolary formats, etc., highlight interesting patterns or relationships between texts in the novel (or texts in the text!). 

**Some Directions:** 

- Read the online lecture for [week 5](http://digitalcultureslab.ca/douglascollege-online1102/winter2017/lecture-module-5/)
- Make sure you have read *JPod* from cover to cover--to the end. 
- I have attached to this Email, a copy of a "Wordle" (a "word cloud" that represents words as bigger based on the number of times it is repeated in the text--the more times the word appears, the bigger it is in the cloud). The attached word cloud uses four of the letters to Ronald McDonald found in *JPod*. What selection would you make from the text for a word cloud? What might it tell us about the words the text (in the selection) emphasizes?
- Look up "geography," "mapping," "cartography," "topography," "setting," "narrative," "symbol," etc., to see if there are ways of representing the novel that differ from the expected. 
- Figure out what different types of maps you might want to deploy. [(Here's a few examples you *might* find useful)](http://weburbanist.com/2011/05/30/creative-cartography-15-artists-transforming-maps/)
- Try to think about how mapping *JPod* helps us understand fractures in narrative, character development, settings (and their role in the narrative), and symbols--particularly the importance of context in understanding symbols or the themes / binaries they might represent.
- Try to think about mapping the narrative as it unfolds topics such as gender representation, references to popular culture, race, consumerism, sexuality. 
- Be creative, daring, but keep all that you have learned in the class up until now in mind.

**Some Provocations:** 
 
You should treat this reader response blog post's directive to "map" as loosely as you need to. In other words, what do we mean by [cartography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartography) or [geography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography) or [place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Location_(geography)) or [topography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topography)? How might words help you find a path through the story, or recognize a pattern of familiarity / distortion? How can you represent how the book makes meaning using mapping as a conceptual underpinning? How would you map the best way to read *JPod* and why would you map it out that particular way (why are you making those choices). Remember the [lecture about intertextuality and binaries](http://digitalcultureslab.ca/douglascollege-online1102/winter2017/lecture-module-5/) and our interpretation of themes. As well, note approaches such as intertextuality and allusion--how might you map these references? Which ones are important and why? 

 If you want, you can actually map out the locations in the novel on a map. You could also draw a map that weights the places mentioned more often by using a different colour--you might remember population maps in elementary and high school, where China and India are huge relative to their land mass and Canada a tiny blip. Work on creating some distortions of the text and how it represents something--what might distorting the text in this way tell us about the novel? How does mapping the novel visualize things we might not notice otherwise?

In short, get some data (words, passages, scenes) from the text, make a map, tell us why you chose to get that data and made the map the way you did. The map can be as simple or complex as you want it to be, but should encourage discussion.
