**Instructions:**

Instructions: Write a Class Lead Module of 500 words that presents a persona for someone--or something--interested in--or who works with--technology. Your persona should represent a particular theme or themes--any ones you want--in the class lead and make an effort to move beyond what would generally be accepted as an accurate representation of someone interested in technology. You might want to represent someone--or something--who is an app developer, a coder, an early adopter, an anti-technologist, a geocacher, a millennial, a computer technician or even someone who supervises robots. Open the net for representation as wide a possible and get your classmates thinking about how we represent people--or things--that come in contact with technology and the cultural themes that might help us understand those representations. You are basically presenting a character sketch that outlines the features marking someone or something interested in technology.

**Some Directions:** 

- Look up [persona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persona) and think about "who" you might be--remember that characteristics that mark general themes such as gender, race, power, etc., are important.  
- Think about how elements of criticism we have encountered, such as theme, symbol, metaphor, intertextuality, might be leveraged to shape your persona.
- Remember that character voices, or narrative voices, can suggest falseness--they can express attitudes or characteristics that real people cannot (or would not). 
- Play with the expectations of your audience--think about what they expect and work to present a persona that offers a oppositional, dominant, negotiated reading, particularly as it applies to the interpretation of culturally-bound symbols.  
- Think about [themes](http://literarydevices.net/theme/) and note how your persona plays with or represents a particular theme (maybe the persona name might suggest that theme?)
- Be creative, daring, but keep all that you have learned in the class up until now in mind
