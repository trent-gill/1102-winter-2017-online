**Instructions:**

Instructions: Write a Class Lead Module of 500 words that offers a dominant, negotiated, and oppositional reading of something you think represents digital culture. This might include such specifics as the iPhone, Netflix, coffee shops, an app, a 3D printer, app makers, coders, self-driving cars, *Grand Theft Auto*, *Pokemon Go*. The only restriction I will offer is that the item, person, group, or technology you choose should be very specific. Do not nest yourself is general things--not "video games" but *Super Mario II for Nintendo*. Focus in on a specific thing, such as those listed above, and think about what that thing might represent. Then, work to describe what the dominant reading is, then the negotiated, then the oppositional. Approach the different stages in that order; don't do oppositional first, then dominant, then negotiated or otherwise. Stick to the order above. 

**Some Provocations:**

- This isn't a test. Do the best you can with what you have in your head. We're not judging the astuteness of your application of Hall's taxonomy, we're just reading your take on it. 
- Read the Wikipedia entry on Stuart Hall's [Encoding / Decoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encoding/decoding_model_of_communication) a few times, and really try to understand it--especially how it asks us to approach problems in defining where our assumptions come from. 
- A helpful way to approach this task is to first think about the object (an Apple MacBook Pro for instance). Then, think about how *everyone* generally views the MacBook Pro, perhaps as exemplified through commercials featuring a Macbook Pro. Then, think about how *some people* might view the MacBook Pro, under what conditions might they view it how they view it? How do *some people* *negotiate* the more general view of *everyone*. Then, think about how a *specific group*, usually on the fringes but not always, might view the MacBook Pro. How does that *specific fringe group* view the MacBook Pro compared to *some people* and *everyone*?
- You would follow the same process as above deciphering the coffee shop--you need to explore a *specific* coffee shop though and first suggest how *everyone* reads it, then how *some people* read it, then how *particular group* reads it. Then, you might ask: which approach is the one that suggests digital culture? What decoding group is that?
- The essence of deploying Hall's theories is about narrowing the focus, moving from generalities to particularities to figure out how different groups *decode* things in different ways.
- Remember our earlier discussions about symbolism, figurative language, intertextuality, and cultural capital. How do we interpret symbols? How might cultural capital influence how we understand, interpret, or visualize symbols? We're building on previous work in the course, try to recognize *how* we're doing that.
