Reader Response Blog Post Prompt #8 - Facebook (Group #3) 
*Ready Player One*  
Due: March 15, 2017 - No later than 5pm - Blackboard Blog  

**Instructions:**

Write a Reader Response Blog Post of 500 words or more illustrating how a 1980s reference shapes character and/or setting and/or language and/or audience expectations in *Ready Player One*. You might choose to emphasize how the reference shapes character, or helps develop a shared language between audience and speaker (an "encoded / decoded" exchange). You can also read closely and determine how the reference works as metaphor, or symbol, helping the reader access a language they might be unaware of, or develop the setting and audience expectations for the story. In every instance, focus on how the 1980s reference is important for understanding—or visualizing—a theme you think is central to—or absent from—*Ready Player One*.

**Provocations and Directions:**  

- Pick a very clearly defined passage in *Ready Player One* (at least 150 words or so) with a 1980s reference in it and work from that to conduct the above task--make sure you have a good example from the text you can comment upon
- Do a quick scan of the general social / cultural conventions that shaped the 1980s
- Review definitions for "theme" and identify a theme that fits with the 1980s reference in *Ready Player One*
- Review definitions for "close reading" 
- Review definitions for "metaphor" and "symbol" 
- Understand how themes (games, virtual reality, social inclusion, esoteric knowledge) in *Ready Player One* are triggered by how objects in the setting are placed and how they are constructed in the story--where are they introduced, what does the reader need to know? why? why are these references important to the story or the reader's understanding of it? 
- Review definitions for "intertextuality" and think about how Stuart Hall's encoding / decoding might play into your approach--how do we "negotiate" the meaning of themes through symbols? 
- Be unafraid of what you don't know and concentrate on making the passage you have chosen mean something.
