Reader Response Blog Post Prompt #2 - Microsoft (Group #2)  
*Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore*  
Due: Jan. 25, 2017 - No later than 5pm - Blackboard Blog  

**Note**: Some of your may wish to review the [tutorial](http://digitalcultureslab.ca/douglascollege-online1102/winter2017/tutorials/) and the [general instructions](http://digitalcultureslab.ca/douglascollege-online1102/winter2017/reader-response-blog-posts/) before you begin.

**Instructions:**

Write a Reader Response Blog Post that, while keeping in mind the definitions of [figurative language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literal_and_figurative_language), [symbol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbol), and [imagery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image#Imagery_.28literary_term.29) generally, introduces us to a *new* symbol in *Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore*. 

---

**Some Directions:** 

- Your post should reflect upon how the new symbol coheres with other symbols in the novel by pointing to specific examples from the text where the symbols collide or react to one another. For instance, if your new symbol is a character make sure that character can interact with other symbols in the novel--the Gerritszoon typeface for example--and explain why your *new* symbol is valid. If your new symbol is an object, why that object? Does it interact in some way with other symbols in the novel, such as the bookstore, Matropolis, Google, *The Dragon-Song Chronicles*, The logbook (note the specifics of these examples)? 
- Don't worry too much about the accuracy or creativity of your new symbol. I'm most interested in how the new symbol interacts with other symbols in the novel. Emphasize how your Reader Response Post reflects your understanding of how symbols work in *Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore* and how they help us imagine the world of the book and/or the character's motivations and/or recognize the value of certain objects over others. 
- Do [the reading](http://digitalcultureslab.ca/douglascollege-online1102/winter2017/course-schedule-and-readings-full/) for this week's module, especially all those literary terms.
- Remember not to generalize, but rather key in on a particular scene and explain how your new symbol changes how we understand the scene or what we take from it. Then, reflect on how your new symbol works to show us something interesting about the novel as a whole.
- Remember to relax and write about what you think is worth talking about. I'm not looking for a right answer from you; I am looking for you to engage with the meaning of the novel *as you see it* taking into account some of the things we have learned so far about literary terminology and its role in interpretation. 

**Some Provocations:** 
 
- Think about how what your symbol represents and why that representation is important for understanding—or imagining—things you think are central to—or absent from—*Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore*. 
- Understand how your symbol represents--in some way--the "stock" elements of literary symbol? Is it a metaphor for evil or good? friendship? hidden things? What does your symbol reveal about a character / setting / mood / narrative? Does it foreshadow anything? Why, or why not?
- Make sure you include some defining features--what does it look like? Why does it look that way? Is it a new thing or an old thing--to what end? 
- Point to a specific moment in the novel where your new symbol would have an effect. Remember, you're supposed to have read the book.
- Keep your audience in mind: what kind of symbols are readers expecting in *Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore*? How does your symbol fit with--or diverge from--those expectations? Why does it do that?
