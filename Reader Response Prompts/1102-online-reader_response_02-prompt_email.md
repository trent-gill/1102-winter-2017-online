Write a Reader Response Blog Post that, while keeping in mind the definitions of [figurative language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literal_and_figurative_language), [symbol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbol), and [imagery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image#Imagery_.28literary_term.29) generally, introduces us to a *new* symbol in *Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore*. 

What You'll Need To Do To Pull This Off Successfully: 

Your post should reflect upon how the new symbol coheres with other symbols in the novel by pointing to specific examples from the text where the symbols collide or react to one another. For instance, if your new symbol is a character make sure that character can interact with other symbols in the novel--the Gerritszoon typeface for example--and explain why your *new* symbol is valid. If your new symbol is an object, why that object? Does it interact in some way with other symbols in the novel such as the bookstore, Matropolis, technology, Google, *The Dragon-Song Chronicles*, The logbook. Don't worry too much about the accuracy or creativity of your new symbol. I'm most interested in how the new symbol interacts with other symbols in the novel. Emphasize how your Reader Response Post reflects your understanding of how symbols work in *Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore* and how they help us imagine the world of the book and/or the character's motivations and/or recognize the value of certain objects over others. 

Some Provocations:

- Think about how what your symbol represents and why that representation is important for understanding—or imagining—things you think are central to—or absent from—*Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore*. 
- Do [the reading](http://digitalcultureslab.ca/douglascollege-online1102/winter2017/course-schedule-and-readings-full/) for this week's module, especially all those literary terms.
- Understand how your symbol represents--in some way--the "stock" elements of literary symbol (is it a metaphor for evil or good? what does it tell us about the story? does it foreshadow anything?)
- Make sure you include some defining features--what does it look like? why does it look that way? is it a new thing or an old thing--to what end? 
- Point to a specific moment in the novel where your new symbol would have an effect. Remember, you're supposed to have read the book.
- Keep your audience in mind: what kind of symbols are readers expecting in *Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore*? How does your symbol fit with--or diverge from--those expectations? Why does it do that?
