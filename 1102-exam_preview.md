1102: Exam Review

**There's some very important technical notes about completing this exam in Blackboard that you should review before you write the exam.**

---

The 1102 Exam will be a mix of short answer and long-form questions. As is noted below, there will be a section that requires some short definitional examples and a section that requires longer, more thoughtful, responses to passages selected from the required texts we encountered in the first half of the course. 

In the preview below, I will work through my expectations for each section. The exam will look like what you see below, but will--obviously--have specific questions. 

>**Section I**: Identify and define the seven (7) terms below in their context of relevance to this course. I.e., briefly suggest for each what/who it is, major defining characteristic(s), and/or its conceptual importance to the topics weâ€™ve been studying, and perhaps, an example.   >7 questions x 3 points each = 21 (Maximum 200 words for each question)

In the section above, I am looking for definitions that reflect how the term was applied, understood, and used in the course. I am **not** looking for a dictionary definition. You should always define the term, as the question notes, "in their context of relevance to this course." That means any term you see in this section needs to be connected to how we discussed the term, or how the lectures defined the term, or how the readings addressed the term.

Always take note of the points awarded for the question. In Section I, each definition you offer is worth three points. As a result, you should cover roughly three major elements of the term. If you see a term such as "violence," you would first define it as a theme (see how this is not the dictionary definition). Then you would refer to how *JPod* addressed the theme of violence. Then, you might point to a specific example: the murder in *JPod* or the bullying. 

Remember that I am testing both your comprehension and your application. I am assessing whether or not you did the reading (can you recognize the term) **and** whether you know how to apply that term or why that term might be relevant to the course. If you read the question, you'll note that it states: "identify and define." That means, at bare minimum, you need to do both. Identify the term (where did it come from, why is it on the exam?) and define (how would we use it, what text shaped our understanding if the term?). Both the identify and define portions of the question require you to do so "in the context of relevance to this course"--so your reply should reference how the term is identified in the course and defined in the course. 

This section cannot be in point form; you must write full sentences. You should have a minimum of three sentences and a maximum of seven. Try to stay within the maximum word count. The word count is a statement, to some extent, of my expectations. If you're babbling on for 350 words, you either don't know the answer or you are over-answering. Doing either of these things will impact your grade. In this section, you either know the answer or you don't. 

>Section II: Below are quotations from the novels we have been studying so far. For each quotation, identify and explain the significance as it is related to any of the interpretive concepts (i.e.: narrative, character, P.O.V.) you have been introduced to so far this semester. You may refer to events or formal elements that occur outside the quote, but your answers should directly address the quote, and the particularities evident in the quote, using the correct interpretive language (i.e.: narrative, character, P.O.V.).  
>Hint: The quotations are not designed to trick you; each has relevance to, is related to, or can help illustrate the features of one or more or the central interpretive concepts (i.e.: narrative, character, P.O.V.) we have covered in the course.  >4 questions x 7 points = 28 (Maximum 350 words for each question)

In this section, you can freewheel a bit more than you can in Section I. In Section II, I am asking for a close reading. You should be able to deploy (use) the literary terminology to make a comment about the impact, significance, narrative role, or development of the passage. Each passage will have multiple interpretations, so there's a number of possible approaches to each quotation. You should rely on your knowledge of close reading strategies and your understanding of how literary terms--character, setting, symbol, etc.--work to reveal things about the text. You can refer to the role of the passage in the text generally, to situate context, but the bulk of your answer should focus in on a particular literary term as it is highlighted--or present--in the passage. 

Again, pay attention to the point-scale. There a seven points here, so you should have something robust to say. You'll want to develop your answers more than you did in section I. That said, the 350-word maximum, again, speaks to my expectations. Section II is not an essay question. 

As in the section above, I am assessing whether or not you did the reading (do you know the text and the literary terms well enough) **and** whether you know how to apply the literary terminology to make suggestions about how the text makes meaning. The section is similar in approach to your essay, except shorter and requiring a more diverse approach. You shouldn't answer all four questions in this section by focusing on character. Try to mix it up a bit; show me what you can do.

**Super-Important Technical Stuff:**

The exam is closed book. I am willing to use the honour system and trust that you will keep your books closed. Please take note of the information below. If you do start looking in books, and searching for answers on the internet, you will burn all sorts of unnecessary time and you might inadvertently close your browser's exam window. **The exam will not stop for you.**

The exam will be timed. You will have one hour and fifty minutes to complete the exam (1:50). You will need to complete the exam in one sitting. **The "Force Completion" option will be turned on**, so make sure you are completely ready to go when you start the exam (go to the bathroom, drinks, snacks, etc. should be at the ready). Make sure you read all testing instructions carefully; the exam timer runs without pause once it is started. **You cannot stop the timer; the exam will automatically submit after one hour and fifty minutes**. If you are done before the time limit, you can and should submit the exam. Once you are ready to submit, click "submit." 

Make sure your internet connection is reliable. If you lose your connection or your connection is too slow, you could be "kicked out" of the test and not allowed back in. **If you leave the exam at any point, in Blackboard, you will not be allowed back into the exam. Once you start the exam, you are committed to finishing it.**  

The exam will be available for 24 hours starting at 5am Feb. 22, 2017 and ending Feb. 23, 2017 at 5am in the "Course Content" section of the class Blackboard space. You can write the exam--once--any time between those hours. If you miss the available window of time, you cannot write the exam.
