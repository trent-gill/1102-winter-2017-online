Lecture #6 

With this online lecture, we're heading into a period of heavy assessment and, as a result, turning our attention toward the direct application of thematic analysis in the course. As you read the below, please keep in mind that we've pivoted and that you should focus on a close reading for Essay #1 and not suddenly turn to a thematic analysis because we've moved on to themes. Stick with what the prompt for Essay #1 is asking for and make sure you are meeting those outcomes.  

First up, a few qualifiers:

1. Essays are due by Email on Wednesday Feb. 15, 2017. Anytime before 11:59pm by Email date-stamp counts as on time.  
2. As far as essays are concerned, please make sure you are aware of the formal requirements. Namely: have a title, MLA citation style in-text and work cited, correct capitalization and emphasis. Review the lecture on essay tips for more about this and get google about what you don't know. 
3. I will post a preview of the mid-term exam next week (probably after the essay due date so you concentrate on one thing at a time). The exam will cover **everything** up to, and including the week ending Feb. 17. Both *JPod* and *Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore*, all the readings around literary terminology, and the more recent stuff around themes, intertextuality, allusion, and cultural capital. If a reading (novel, essay, wikipedia definition, chapter, video, slideshow) appears on the schedule or in the class lectures, it is in play. The exam will not directly address the Reading Response Blogs or the Activity Prompts. 
4. Studying for the exam is best approached by working to understand the interrelationships between the definitions of key literary terms, their deployment and exemplification in the novels, and of course the significance and shape of the novels themselves. Most often, you will need to apply the concepts of the course to perform textual analysis or contextualize a definition. Rather than memorizing specifics, pay attention to how we have used, illustrated, or defined the texts in the course so far. 

With all that said, we are now pivoting toward thematic analysis, as I note above. We are now turning our attention to understanding how themes are represented in the literature we have encountered, and will encounter, in the course. To this end, we will be building off our knowledge of key literary terms and close reading to apply those literary terms and strategies for close reading to interpreting how texts represent themes. 

**What is a theme?**

Themes, generally, have some consistent definitional components. Below, I cover off the important ones, but others will emerge as we encounter different representational approaches and as we bring in our own cultural perspectives to bear on the literary texts. 

1. Themes tend to transgresses texts and boundaries. Themes, unlike most symbols and metaphors, are not linked irrevocably to the text in which it is represented. A theme such as "loneliness" will be the focus of many different texts, whereas the symbol for loneliness, say that of a leaf, falling isolated and alone, from a tree, will appear only in a poem by E. E. Cummings. Point is, as I note in last week's lecture, themes are abstract concepts where symbolic meaning is wrapped up in specific things (a leaf, as per the example above). 
2. Themes tend to represent some common cultural belief, or set of beliefs. Themes, even as abstract concepts, are commonly understood. We all understand what love is, no matter what culture we come from, but how we choose to represent love is different. Helping us understand the differences in our representations of love is, some would argue, the central function of literature and literary interpretation. Themes then help us categorize our thinking so that we recognize patterns, sequences, and similarities in representations. Along these lines, you might ask: why do we often represent the concept of love through flowers, lips, and hearts?
3. Themes tend to be embodied or represented in a symbol (fixed to the text as above), but one that has universally recognized traits. For example, take the theme of detection. Our primary representation of detection is the detective, but let's look at some differences between how male and female detectives are represented (how you visualize the detective based on the description):
		- Male detectives tend to be strong, violent, street smart, a loner. They tend to have chiseled features and are more cunning than the criminals they are searching for and others are afraid of the potential harm that might come to them if they double-cross these male detectives (they are intimidating). Some examples might be Sherlock Holmes, Bulldog Drummond, Thomas Magnum, Philip Marlowe, Adrian Monk, Hercule Poirot, and Sam Spade--note how the names actually *represent* the characteristics above, we're all magnums, spades, bulldogs, Hercules. 
		- Female detectives tend to be smart, tender, connected to a unique set of friends. They tend to use there sexuality to their advantage (as distraction or allure) and rely on others under-estimating their abilities rather than being afraid of their abilities (they're not at all intimidating). Some examples might be Nancy Drew, Miss Marple, Precious Ramotswe, Veronica Mars, Lis Salander, Jessica Fletcher, Temperance Brennan, Marge Gunderson, and Sabrina Duncan, Jill Munroe, and Kelly Garrett (Charlie's Angels). Note how few of these women you've heard of and, now the names are quite different sounding, even "temperate."
		- The point here is that the theme of detection is universally understood as, basically, how someone goes above 	finding something out. However, how that theme is represented through character is quite different depending on the gender one chooses to look at. If we go even deeper, we might look at the unique traits of Lis Salander to see how she challenges our assumptions around the traditional representations of a detective. Or, we might look at Sherlock Holmes as a way of understanding the historical underpinning of the detective character. Or, still, we might look at how Benedict Cumberbatch reacquainted us with the traditional mode of detection after the destabilizing rupture of Lis Salander. Any *one* of these approaches might work for an undergraduate-level essay. 
		- In any event, we are looking at patterns of representation. How do examples from the text add up to tell us something about how something is represented to us--how we visualize that object, character, setting, or POV? Then, we're focusing on the patterns, sequences, and similarities / differences in representation and making a claim about what those things might mean to our understanding of--or expectations for--the theme more generally.  
4. Themes tend to be connected to some moral element of human understanding. We use themes to help us understand the fundamentals of human behaviour. Themes of "goodness" help us understand what it mean sto be good (and, by the absence of it, bad). In short, themes are a way of passing on information--usually moral--about how to behave properly and live life in a particular--usually proper--way.   
5. Themes tend to be a very abstract term, one that needs to be defined through specifics (literary terms) and the things those specifics might represent. So, a theme of "love" is very abstract. We need examples from texts to help us understand what it really means--and there are hundreds of different meanings. In every case, we are using texts to exemplify the specific characteristics of a theme. So, there might be a pattern of symbols, language, or objects that suggest a theme and then, expanding beyond that, there might be a pattern of representations that help us understand a theme in a culture, epoch, or temporal period. 

**Themes Can Be:**

Often, we take themes and then smash them together to create binaries. For instance, we can use literary terms and smash them against themes to think about the relationship between symbolic representation and the definition of a theme. 

There are big themes, such as Power, Tradition, Coming of Age, The Meaning of Life, Communication, Mortality, Race, Love, Sex, Identity, Cultural Differences, Nature, Morality, Religion, Social Justice, and History, to name but a few. We can take these big themes and could them with a literary term (character, setting, symbol, metaphor, atmosphere, etc., represented below as "X") to see how the literary subject represents the theme: X vs. Society; X vs. Power; X vs Tradition, X vs Nature; X vs X; X as representation of Social Justice and so on. 

We can also think about the more specific sub-sets of the big themes such as Consumption, Chaos, Capitalism, Companionship, Disillusionment, Displacement, Family, Heroism, Injustice, Isolation, Knowledge, Loneliness, Motherhood, Nationalism, Oppression, Role of the Individual, Selfhood, Social Mobility, Technology, Vanity, and War. We can smash these against literary subjects or indeed against each other. How do representations of consumption lead to chaos in *JPod* for instance? How might the representation of knowledge lead to a particular representation of family makeup in *Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore*?  

In each instance, we are using the text to exemplify (provide us with examples of) the patterns of representation that help us define a particular theme, which is why close reading is so important--we need examples, real things from the text. 

We can also be even more specific about themes, getting into sub-sets or the sub-sets. Themes such as: Arrogance, Art, Belief, Bravery, Children, Common sense, Conservation, Conspiracy, Corruption, Courage, Death, Democracy, Desire, Despair, Failure, Family, Fate, Feminism, Freedom, Friendship, Happiness, Hate, Heritage, Identity, Ideology, Ignorance, Innocence, Isolation, Jealousy, Justice, Kindness, Loyalty, Passion, Patriotism, Peer Pressure, Prejudice, Pride, Quests, Revolution, Revenge, Survival, Time, Vice, Violence. 

Finally, we can get specific about the sub-sets of the sub-sets of the sub-sets, often implying a connection between literary device and the theme itself: Adversity, Aging, Change, Childhood, Courage, Deception, Faith, Fame, Grief, Hope, Imagination, Memory, Music, Pain, Patience, Trust, Work.

Again, in each instance, we are using the text to exemplify (provide us with examples of) the patterns of representation that help us define a particular theme, which is why close reading is so important--we need examples, real things from the text. We are looking at patterns, sequences, and similarities of things from the text to discover how those patterns, sequences, and similarities from the text might be used to define a theme, suggest a unique understanding of a theme, or challenge our assumptions about the "general concept" for a theme. 

**What's Important:**

The main thrust of literary study--and textual criticism in general (but not for essay #1)--is to connect literary terminology, exemplified in the text at hand, to the representation of a theme. 

The main purpose for understanding interpretive concepts such as allusion / intertextuality and cultural capital is to provide context for understanding themes and recognizing how patterns of representation shape a cultural situation or interpret themes for us. For instance, 
	- a consistent pattern of under-representation is problematic for our understanding of self-hood (How do women understand selfhood if men are always writing female characters? How do we understand race if only White people are writing about race?).
	- a consistent pattern of representing nationalism tells us who we are as a cultural group (think about how Tim Horton's "represents" Canada in its commercials--think about the *pattern*, usually hockey, snow, driving, cottage-life, etc., and how those things represent Canadian Nationalism).
	- a consistent pattern of representation (as a criminal, for instance) tells us our bias or flawed assumptions about our cultural ideologies
	- a consistent pattern of perspective (from the male POV only) tells us *how* that view might be subjective or one-dimensional (see above and the objectification of women or racial profiling). 
	- a consistent pattern of representation around a single theme (friendship, for instance) tells us how "friendship" might look so we know when we have a friend (as accepted by the social construct of friendship--represented as a theme). 
On and on this goes until we're sick to death of talking about it, but closer to understanding the fluidity of a theme such as friendship or the underlying assumptions of representations of racial minorities or women or, if you like, men who cry. 

As a way of contextualizing this more broadly, you might think about the larger themes that organize your program of study; what themes are present in what you are studying:
	- Nursing - patient care, knowledgeable practice, death, dying, sickness, heath, inspiration, hard work
	- Therapeutic Recreation - physical activity, creative thinking, leisure, guidance
	- Psychology - individuals, mental health, power dynamics, motivation, attitude, social dynamics
Certainly, there are other aspects to what you love about life that are organized around themes. There's holidays (Halloween is organized around themes, as is Valentine's Day). Try to think about the underlying representational assumption of those themes and how texts support, resist, or distort those assumptions.

Below is an episode of the CBC series version of *JPod*. Feel free to watch the whole thing, but you don't have to--just watch the first two minutes, to the credits; it won't be on the exam!

<center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0RQLtTKc-M0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>

Take note of your assumptions: is this how you pictured Ethan? The JPod itself? Cowboy? 

Then, note that in difference to the novel, the TV version seems to be foreground a search for love as a central theme--capitalizing upon the suspense (see Sam and Diane on *Cheers*, or Ross and Racheal on *Friends* or Leonard and Penny on *The Big Bang Theory*--see what I just did there? PATTERNS). The TV version also focuses on the irony of how the JPodders do not take their work seriously, despite it being a place of work. Finally, note how the opening credits focus our attention on some of the thematic concerns of the show, foreshadowing what we should be looking for--drugs, computers, numbers, etc.

In short, the TV representation of *JPod* is someone else's interpretation of the novel's central themes. Someone has read the book and thought, "alright, how do I make this into a TV show that emphasizes a few themes that people will be interested in?"

Thinking about what the TV Show leaves out, leaves in, or emphasizes, will tell you a lot about how themes appear in texts. That said, do not forget: themes help us categorize our thinking so that we recognize patterns, sequences, and similarities in representations in a text. We **must use** the text to exemplify the characteristics of a theme before we can make a claim about how the text represents a theme. So, Bree's letters in *JPod* can represent the theme of sexual empowerment, not *JPod* has aspects that represent sexual empowerment. You need to explain how examples taken from Bree's letters in the text suggest characteristics of sexual empowerment; you're not allowed to simply speak to sexual empowerment in the novel--**you need to include specific details and examples from the text that prove the theme is present**.    
   
Alright, chew on this for awhile and we'll pick up on this thread next week!
