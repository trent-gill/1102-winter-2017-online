Lecture #12 - Lovelace and Babbage

What we're looking for in *The Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage* is how the novel represents a nice exit point for some of the major themes of the course--the quest, friendship, immortality, history, alternative universes (or spaces), technology--and also brings us to encounter interesting questions around gender, erased histories, the value of cultural capital, and the "other." In short, *The Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage* represents a capstone novel of the course. 

What I'll do here is pick up on some of the subjects we discussed in class and try to model ways of interpreting or "interrogating" the text so that we can make comments about its significance and how it makes meaning. But first, a few assumptions:

1. Remember that we need to account for our expectations as readers. We need to understand how the text and its story match with what we expect or, more importantly, how and where it doesn't match those expectations. Note that this doesn't mean assessing whether or not the novel is good or bad; expectations need centre around questions of **meaning** not value. We talked about these fractures early on in the course; places where the narrative logic is broken, characters behave in ways that make us curious about their motivations, the setting shifts and brings other locales and spaces into opposition or comparison. We should entirely avoid comments about author intentions or the text's ability to be "effective," "realistic," have "aspects of" anything--"Padua is very effective at aspects of realism..."--and move toward the analysis--"The character of Lovelace represents a significant shift in representations of the Victorian female..."
2. Meaning does not exist in a vacuum. As I noted when we played the video games, we bring a lot of cultural capital to our understanding of what we read (or play!). We fill in a lot of blanks. We also miss many references if we do not have the cultural capital to understand immediately. It's important for you to do some sleuthing on your own and figure out what some of the contexts for your readings are, but *The Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage* does that in the footnotes too. Take the time to bring the context into the reading of the novel, much as the video games we played made *Ready Player One* a little more accessible. 
3. *The Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage* is a speculative reading that reimagines a history that did not happen. One could argue that all the books we have read (poems such as "Agrippa" and "Sestina" too!) are imagined pasts--fictions that recount imaginary events--virtual worlds ("Pocket Universe," "The OASIS," "Agrippa"'s photo album, Google, meeting Douglas Coupland in Douglas Coupland's book). The point here is that this tells us something both about how fiction is constructed (based on reality but not reality) and also how we choose to represent the past (always in relation to some event, some narrative retelling of a story). All the texts we have read in the second half of the course begin after the events have occurred. History then, and how we create, represent, and interpret it, is a looming elephant. When we think about what's missing, left out, misrepresented, or outright made up, the stability of meaning takes a hit--and that's where we want to focus our attention.
4. *The Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage* is a comic book (or, if you're more nerdy, a graphic novel). It represents things in a very different way than a text of only written prose. Try to think about how to account for the differences between a visualized narrative and a written one. What do I mean? Well, think about how space is used in *The Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage*--figures appear all over the page. Sometimes, we move from left to right and mimic the act of reading (itself a historically-bound form of cultural knowledge) and other times we don't move at all; still other times we move all over the page in different or without a traditional left-to-right logic. How then does this change the act of reading?

**Okay, now that we've covered that off, on to the MULTIVERSE OF INTERPRETATION!!**

In the following, I present an image from the text and interrogate it. See if you can follow the logic and to some extent try to deploy that scaffolding--the logic of my interpretation, not *my interpretation*--to your own reading of a passage. In every case below, I am analyzing and / or interpreting, but I'm not saying which and when--you do some work! [winkface]

[See below, how I am imitating the *footnote* style of the book? That's me being clever; but you should have known and recognized the allusion (wait! that's a key term! what does that even mean!? will it be on the exam!? (I'll wait)]

*This final panel (that's what we call the squares or group of squares that makes up the novel's text) of the narrative proper--there are lots of other drawings, but they come as part of the endnotes--nicely encapsulates some of the novel's major interjections:

1. It alludes to the "The Person from Porlock" anecdote that ended section one and began the larger narrative, thus closing off the text by referring to its beginning. That in and of itself is an interesting maneuver because it suggests coherence in what is a very fractured and disconnected sequence of stories--the text is not a long, drawn out, story but rather a sequence of short stories about different "adventures" that the two characters go on. 
2. It suggests that Ada knows the truth--the real history--despite her adventures in the "Pocket Universe." At the same time, her "crazy" appearance--big eyes, frazzled hair, compressed gait--re-establish her within the representational confines of the Victorian Woman or, how women were portrayed and thought-of in the Victorian era, as fragile and potential hysterical. If we turn the page in the novel, we see the Rabbit from *Alice in Wonderland*, an inter-textual reference to a girl's fantasy world; I'll let that one sit with you (BUT WHAT ARE THE PARALLELS???? (sorry... I couldn't let it sit... how is this book that' s maybe all about restoring Ada Lovelace and representing powerful women now thwarted by putting in a reference to *Alice in Wonderland*... maybe empowered women *is* a fantasy world... no... wait!! "Wonderland" is another virtual world!! We've been discussing those in the course... wow... mind[blown]mind).
3. The question about "madness" (as in insanity) asked at the end is an interesting one, both as it references the hysterical woman in Victorian-era England generally, but also the uncertainty that Ada Lovelace's temporal shift--she knows the truth--creates in the reader. Madness is a central theme in digital culture as well--all the great tech inventors are crazy, think of Apple's ad campaigns in the late 1990s.

*Note how all but a few of the "crazy ones" are artists (the others are outsiders, political non-conformists. What might that say about how Apple wants us to think of "crazy"? 

*If you are interested in representations of women in the Victorian Era, read "The Yellow Wallpaper" by Charlotte Perkins Gilman and *Madwoman in the Attic* by Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar. But I digress...

*This image is interesting because it both tells us the truth about the past--brevity is its strong suit--and hints at how we should understand the book. In other words, it alludes the the kind of cultural capital we will have to deploy to fully understand the novel's reference point: how the Victorian Era is similar to our own Era, particularly as it involves technology and computers. So, from this page onward, we are looking for symbols, metaphors, settings, representations, characteristics that signal computers, technology or digital culture.

Imagine how we would read the book if that last line, "The first computers were not built until the 1940s," were not present. 

You might also want to think about that word "computers." The term [computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_computer) used to refer to the women who did the computation. Is this a hint that true woman's liberation didn't happen until the 1940s? WIKI Could be. Kinda true. Anyhoo, take a look at the entry on [computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer) at wikipedia... no mention of Ada. hmmm....erased. But Babbage is mentioned in the [Ada Lovelace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace) entry...

If you follow the etymology of computers along, it would appear that all computers are women...

*This page is interesting in the way that it blends temporal periods to force into reflections about the nature of technology and its purpose--or lack of purpose for that matter. The pages are also a good example of how the footnotes work in *The Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage*.

The Queen's reaction to the Difference Engine extends her initial preoccupation with everything that the machine *doesn't* do. She wants "our difference engine" to fight crime and is convinced of its worth only when it produces a kitten. Babbage of course, being a man of precision, is horrified to see all the errors. What's more interesting for us though is the way the passage uses our cultural capital to inject humour into the scene. We live in an era full of internet LOL cats, and the Duke's "LOL!" exclamation reminds us of them. The statement trivializes the role of technology, suggesting that its only real use is as entertainment. 

The footnotes further qualify the situation by humanizing computers as things that are "yearning to express themselves artisitically." The inclusion of such a footnote--computers, in most cases are unthinking and inanimate without a human interfacing with them--prioritizes the role of the arts and the place of the arts as the dominate or normative form of expression. The book then is about art, not computers. The book is about how to make art--which happens to be represented through the symbol of the Difference Engine--itself now a machine that helps Ada produce trivial picutres of cats that another woman also enjoys (see, go back up top and think about how all the women looking at cats and enjoying it makes them appear shallow and incapable of grasping complex computations and reason--another subversion of female empowerment despite representations otherwise in the book. 

The other footnotes, on page 81, again references a Victorian figure of importance--Sherlock Holmes (you know him as [Benedict Cumberbatch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_(TV_series)); another great example of speculative reading about Victorian Era London placed in the present day). The footnote's referencing of an academic paper also hints at the narrator's expertise--or lack thereof--in understanding the intricacies of Victorian England. The narrator--the voice speaking in the footnotes--is just as unclear about things, but has done some reading and now assures us that they understand the nuances of Victorian Knighthoods. While we have no evidence to support skepticism, we can at least identify with this narrator who is trying to decipher and accumulate cultural capital. 

Suffice to say, the footnotes provide interesting interpretive context and when held up to scrutiny reveal biases and perspectives that rhyme with the way the novel is representing or reviving histories. At the same time, these pages show a diminished authority in the Queen and a lack of awareness on her part about the potential for the Difference Engine. She is not an authoritative head of state in control of two-thirds of the planet, but a vapid, presumptuous dilettante, who wields her power through complements as veiled insults--Guelphic Order.

*This one is real quick: Ada actually plunges into the machine and is enveloped by it. When she does so, she removes her Victorian garb, literally stripping away the constraints of society to move into the machine. It's a powerful metaphor that represents the shedding of her restrictive dress, and the moral and intellectual codes associated with it to descend into the domain of the machine. It could also be read as a decent into hell--exactly where a sinner who strips off her morals would be thought to belong in Victorian England. That the machine surrounds her with signs that say "wrong" is a powerful commentary on her freedom from the dress.

*See that above: deconstruction. While the panels represent one thing, they also represent another. But, if we only read surfaces, we just buy one of the readings--depends on what we bring with us in terms of expectations--Stuart Hall. Some might resist and read these panels as a representation of female persecution, punishment for casting off the shackles of Victorian society. Some might read these panels as representative of female empowerment as she works to solve problems in a space traditionally the domain of men.

<div>[caption id="attachment_324" align="aligncenter" width="768"]<img src="http://digitalcultureslab.ca/hybrid1102/fall2016-001/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_0359-768x1024.jpg" alt="Padua 92" width="768" height="1024" class="size-large wp-image-324" /> Padua 92[/caption]</div>

*These two examples show Babbage occupying the superficial role--at least representationally--sometimes associated with female characters. He's obsessed not with reason and cool separation from events, but clearly has an aesthetic stake in his own representation and the representation of what he makes. He's concerned with how he looks and how what he makes looks like. He wants to be well-liked and he wants his machine to be beautiful. It's a very modern sense of masculinity to feel this way--and in some ways it's still an uncomfortable representational space for men--we often give it names like "metrosexual" for instance. 

The point here is that Babbage often plays counter-point to Lovelace's empowered woman; whatever she takes to make herself push into masculine spaces, he loses and then takes on that which she sheds. Babbage becomes hysterical where Lovelace becomes calculating--key word to describe her charateristics that one; Babbage becomes superficial where Lovelace becomes concerned with application and use value.

Taken from the "Endnotes" of the "User Experience" chapter, this panel is a bit of an oddball. However, the reading I'm giving is not about character, so it might serve as a model for other approaches to critical interpretation of the text.

*The drawing is a good example of how pictorial representation (pictures) augments textual representation (words). Five billion anything is a lot, but when we try to imagine that number inside that square, we get a sense of how densely complex our computer systems really are. On the facing page (212), the narrator also clues us in on the limitations of pictorial representation noting that "The NOT circuit is too hard to draw." One could argue that both of these images are of things that are "too hard to draw" and are thus saved by the context of words. Words tell us how to understand the picture--without the words, we're forced into a situation where we have to guess at what something means. 

This correlation of image and text is a very good example of how meaning does not occur in a vacuum, something I noted in class this week. Think hard about what is too hard to draw or too hard to write about. What might that be? How are we coming at texts and augmenting them with our own cultural capital in the same way that the words in the picture above help us understand and read the meaning of a black square?

Think about what is not "drawn" or "written"--the term "inscribed" works even better here--in this novel, and the others we have read this semester. Who / What is left out and why? Who / What is included and why?

Bring things, tangible, viable, interesting, present, patterned, things, together and see what consistencies emerge. Think about how these things make suggestions to you about what they mean. Think about how your context is put to use in the fictions you read to manipulate how you receive meaning--for good and bad.

*As a final nugget, I'll leave you with this: what if Lovelace and Babbage were South Asian? What would need to change? Could we still write about Victorian England? Could we still write about a kind of Difference Engine? Probably not, right? So, this tells us that while the book pushes for empowerment, pushes us to think more broadly about the invention of computers and the gender / sexual politics underlying their invention, the historical narratives that are erased, it is also reaffirming the place of Western History in the creation of computers. In other words, *The Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage*, innovative, restorative, and revisionist as it might be, still foregrounds a White, English, Heterosexual, Anglo-American past as the foundation for innovation, empowerment, and creativity. The story excludes because it does not include--though the footnotes do a good job of affirming expertise and telling us *how* to read the novel (but they are still open to skepticism!!!).

I'll leave you with this, it's on the back of many of the phones you carry with you: "Designed by Apple in California. Assembled in China." 

Think about how these two sentences, separated by the insertion of a period, fullstop, signal a politicized hierarchy (China assembles, they don't invent, design, or even make) / California does all the brainwork. In so doing, these separated places (California--not USA??--and China (a country, not just the largest State in the Union)) are doing two different things; one has cache and is involved in creative thinking and the production of cultural capital; the other merely assembles what it has in front of it, mindlessly. California is a *place* of activity and thoughtfulness. Whereas China is a *country* of repetitive mindlessness. 

Inherent here is the ambiguity as well: *what* is designed--the phone, the software, the graphics, the circuitry, the glass, the plastic? *What* is assembled--the phone, the software, the graphics, the circuitry, the glass, the plastic? How do we understand the differences and how do we place value on them? If something is only "designed" is it ever real? It would seem that assembly is essential. Without that action we can never use the design. So, which place performs the more important function?  

All this noted, one fact remains: together, these two countries produce and make accessible to a large number of people the most arresting and game-changing piece of machinery in the last 25 years. 

So, which of the places noted above, in the reading I just gave, is Lovelace and which is Babbage?  

Is Lovelace more like California? How? Why? Why not? Give examples.  
Is Babbage more like China? How? Why? Why not? Give examples.  
Is Lovelace more like China? How? Why? Why not? Give examples.    
Is Babbage more like California? How? Why? Why not? Give examples.
