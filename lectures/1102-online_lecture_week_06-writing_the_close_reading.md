Some Writing Tips for English 1102:
Essays for English Literature

**Some Rules for Approach:**

- Work from the text, outward. Start with a specific example from the text and work toward explaining how that example means something.
- Avoid big contextual statements at the beginning about meaning and / or representation--nothing about "technology" or "daily life" or "today's world" or "fast-paced" or "subliminal meanings"--concentrate on the text and the patterns that make meaning as illustrated through the text, then move to broad claims.  
- You are trying to show that you can *use* the text as an example to make a claim (or "reading") about what the novel means, or comments upon. Be careful that you do not write a book review; I am assuming you read the book. You are not responsible for showing me that you read the book, or that you understood it. You *are* responsible for using the text to make a claim for how we might read it: what assumptions are confirmed or debunked, what do symbols mean, how do characters interact, what is the effect of the setting on atmosphere or mood or characters?
- Your paragraphs--or segments (because sometimes you need more than one paragraph to pull things off appropriately)--should be "top-heavy." 
	- Begin with a topic sentence that introduces the subject for discussion (a symbol, item, place, person--a **thing**)
	- Introduce evidence from the text (quotation here, direct evidence, not too long), then contextualize it a bit: how will you be speaking to this piece of evidence?
	- Analyze the evidence: what does your evidence illustrate? How does it do that? Why does it do that? What is the significance of that? 
	- Transition into the next segment: remind the reader what your interpretation is in your thesis and how the evidence supports that reading, then move to the next item. 
- I am not the audience for your essay. The audience for your essay is a person who has read the book and wants to know what you think it means. Avoid writing for my expectations, write about what you think is interesting about the text's meaning, interpretation, potential statements.

**Get the Basics Correct:** 
 
- Make sure you have the character’s names correct, the novel title, etc.
- No unnecessary information. Your audience has read the book, knows the story and the plot. Do not spend time recounting these things unless they are relevant to your textual example.
- References to the events inside the novel use the present tense: "Douglas Coupland *appears* in the text." / "Kat *is* a woman who *wants* to get ahead."
- Locate your essay in things, examples, and explanations about their meaning rather than pointing to potentials (words such as “aspects,” “issues,” “parts” all suggest things that are missing–*NAME!!! the specific “aspects” or “issues” or “parts”! What are they, specifically? You need to reference objects, people, items.*
- Make sure the formatting is correct. The essay should follow MLA formatting (google it, or [follow this link](https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/747/01/)
- Titles of novels get *italicized* and always use double quotation marks, not single: "like this" not 'like this.'

**A Kinda Walkthrough:**

The best way to approach essay #1 is to foreground your scene. As I modelled in the last lecture, you'll want to work through the details of your scene or scenes. You're looking for patterns, or peculiarities in how the text represents something. To do this, you might need to alter the sequence of the scenes--don't just follow the linear progression of the novel. If you have two examples, one from the beginning of the novel and one from the end, feel free to put the example from the end first in your essay if that's what works. **Always use the evidence so that your point is strong**; this means you might present evidence in a different sequence than it appears in the text--that's fine. 

For the sake of an example, I will walk through a close reading of the scene below, taken from *Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore* (123). Remember, what I am doing here isn't really an essay example, and it's not meant to be prescriptive. Instead, think of the walkthroughs here are scaffolding for how you *might* approach the essay yourself. Make sure you take a careful look at the "Close Reading - Prose Fiction" reading in Module #5 to get a more "textbook" sense of what's being asked of you for Essay #1. 

Here's the selection from *Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore* (123): 

>Now: I’m dealing with too much information here. I only want to see who borrowed what. Kat’s analysis was smart enough to tag names and titles and times in the text, and the visualization knows how to plot those, so I link the data to display and I see something familiar: a swarm of colored lights bouncing through the shelves, each one representing a customer. These, though, are customers from years ago.
	It doesn’t look like much—just a colorful mess migrating through the Waybacklist. Then, on a hunch, I connect the dots, so it’s not a swarm but a set of constellations. Every customer leaves a trail, a drunken zigzag through the shelves. The shortest constellation, rendered in red clay, makes a tiny Z, just four data points. The longest, in a dark moss, curves around the whole width of the store in a long jagged oval.

Here's how I might go about coming up with a thesis statement about what this scene means. I'm doing a series of revisions because you should expect to do so as well. Your argument won't be clear right away: 

First go: Mr. Penumbra’s 24-Hour Bookstore suggests that making sense of information overload is as simple as rendering real-world data through computer visualization.

Second revision: Mr. Penumbra’s 24-Hour Bookstore represents making sense of information in an old-world way, understanding information through computer visualization.

Third revision: Old-world knowledge continually creeps into Mr. Penumbra’s 24-Hour Bookstore and its representations of technological solutions.

Notice how I have moved the subject of my analysis (old-world knowledge) to the front of my sentence. While I will be using the text of the novel to provide an example, the essay is really about how old-world knowledge is represented in the novel. Where words, actions, symbols, settings, etc., of old-world knowledge infiltrate the technological emphasis.

Now, a few examples of how we would use the text to support the above claim, note how I parse out the scene above, integrating it into my paragraph. The block-quote above is just for me, in my rough work. Below is how you should integrate it more formally in the essay:

When Clay notes [present tense!] that “Kat’s analysis was smart enough to tag names and titles and times in the text, and the visualization knows how to plot those” (123), he suggests that the power of vision is central to understanding information, not just the computer’s crunching of numbers. The presence of “tags,” “titles,” “times” in the text suggest that the information needed to understand “too much information” (123) must be geared toward the sensory world of the human being. Computers alone cannot help us understand patterns or histories, Clay needs to “see something familiar: a swarm of colored lights” (123) that will guide his analysis. That guided analysis, not the his computer savvy, or even Kat’s access to all the computer savvy in the world, will be what helps Clay decipher the mythologies of the past that dominant the narrative of *Mr. Penumbra’s 24-Hour Bookstore*.

Now, if you look at that last sentence, it reads like a little better thesis than the one we have up top. So, we edit again: 

Fourth revision: Old-world, sensory knowledge and interactions with the real world continually creep into Mr. Penumbra’s 24-Hour Bookstore colliding with mythologies of technological solutions.

OR

Fifth revision: Knowledge acquired through human senses, not through computer interactions or technological solutions, help Clay decipher the mythologies of the past that dominant the narrative of Mr. Penumbra’s 24-Hour Bookstore.

From here, we could go back and forth with the quoted text above, and then move outward to make a claim about the “mythologies of the past” that the book harbours.

Point is, we move back and forth between the quote, using THE ACTUAL WORDS IN THE QUOTE, to develop and progress through a reading of the novel’s meaning.

**A Few Other Things to Avoid: Some Examples:**

If you were to write something such as: “The use of POV here helps to further develop the theme that we shouldn’t rely on technology as much as we do now.”

I would suggest that you:
 
- Do not make references to the outside or “real world”; we need to focus on what the text means
- Write out “point-of-view”; no short-forms
- If you drop a term such as “theme,” you better be clear about what that is and it better refer to the novel in question

---

If you were to write something such as: “Kat Potente is a female character in the novel. The main characteristics of Kat were she is an attractive girl. Clay had a crush on her.”

I would say / ask:

- This is all pointless information. Anyone who has read the book would know this stuff. instead, talk about what she represents
- What does it mean that she is attractive, what does that signal?
- What does Clay’s attraction to Kat do to him? How does it affect him?

---

If you were to write something such as: “In the novel, JPod, written by Douglas Coupland, Ethan is a main character with aspects of symbolism.”

I would note and ask: 

- This sentence is horrible for an essay. We know it’s a novel, we know it was written by Coupland, we know Ethan is a character.
- What are the “aspects of symbolism”? Name them.
- Sentence should read something like: “Ethan represents the affects of consumerism and how it affects an individual’s ability to understand his/her reality.”

---

If you were to write something such as: “Neel Shah is an Indian character that demonstrates the diversity and different point of view where inserted into the story.”

I would tell you to: 

- Show me, using a specific textual example, where the novel actually states Neel is “Indian”
- Show me, using specific textual examples, the diversity he demonstrates
- Show me, using specific textual examples, the different point of view Nell offers
- Show me, using specific textual examples, where is changes the story
- The bottom line here is to focus on what’s in the quotation you choose and how that material suggests a larger meaning, or provides an example for some larger meaning, in the novel. You must locate your analysis in the textual examples. If you don’t, you will struggle to generate word count and you will tend to generalize wildly rather than make a reasonable claim based on sound interpretation.

**Alright kids. Good Luck!! You can do this!!**
