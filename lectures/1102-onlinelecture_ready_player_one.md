We've slowed things down over the last couple of weeks. This is on purpose. I'm sure you've been rolling through mid-terms and other commitments, and I wanted to give everyone time to acclimate and get caught up with the reading. If you're not caught up, finished *Ready Player One* and *The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage*, you better get cracking--there's only four weeks left in the course!!

In any event, this week I wanted to pick up on some themes in *Ready Player One* with a mind to get you thinking about how you might approach the questions in the second Essay Assignment. There are a few basic things to remember about *Ready Player One* from a comprehension standpoint. Things that inform the themes and their interpretation through the text. At the same time, we need to remember to base our analysis in deploying the literary terms first, and then building up to make a claim about what themes are important in the text. 

One thing I like to emphasize about *Ready Player One* is that everyone in the novel is playing the game. All the main characters are involved in the Egg Hunt. This is important because right of the top, we have a connection to games, and the idea of game play, which I reviewed in an earlier lecture (Module 10, to be exact). Games are interesting because, like themes, the baseline "types" or "forms" for games are consistent throughout history and even across cultures. In fact, understanding how games are consistent forms of representation can help contextualize how we should look at themes. Keeping that idea of consistency and congruency in mind, let's walk through some themes in *Ready Player One* and their characteristics. 

---

**Reality (or different *kinds of* reality):**

- The question the text makes us ask is: "what version of reality are we in and when are we in it?"
	- Is The OASIS a real place? And if so, what makes it real? 
	- When would we say Wade, Helen, and Art3mis are in a reality? Is it all the time? What reality do they occupy? 
- The point here is that setting plays a big role in helping us explore the theme of reality 
	- What determines a character's perspective (POV) of that reality? 
	- How does a character behave or look differently depending on the reality they find themselves in? 
	- What are the layers of reality? (at one point, Wade is in a headset in one reality; inside The OASIS generally; then in a specific place in The OASIS; then mimicking the plot-line to a movie (*War Games*) that is itself set in a real-world fiction--it's very hard to keep track of where reality starts and fantasy begins)
- Is the OASIS a positive space? If so, what about it signals a positive space? How is it relative to the Stacks for instance? What is being emphasized in the OASIS? (games, education, the 1980s, alternative worlds, avatars...) What is being ignored in the OASIS? (This leads us to other themes: Escapism, Willful Ignorance, Neglect, Family...) See, everything just comes pouring out once you turn on the tap...)

**Identity / Persona / Appearance:**

- We've looked at all of the above in one form or another throughout the course, but they all merge nicely in *Ready Player One* to emphasize the role things such as appearance play in our representation or the cultural qualities we want to represent (themes such as rebellion, belonging, manipulation, truth, being).
	- Who is who in *Ready Player One*?
		-  And, importantly, when are they who they are? (it can all get to be a bit like going down an endless rabbit-hole of representation--when it what when it is what it is...!?!?!? BUT:)
		- Is the main character in the novel Wade, or his avatar / persona Parzival?
		- Is Aech a Caucasian male or a African American Lesbian named Helen?
		- Does Art3mis have a birthmark or not?
		- Is Anorak alive and Halliday dead or is Halliday alive through Anorak? 
	- In short, there are implications for each character when we consider how their identity is tied up in personas, appearances, and reality (see above).
	- As well, we should be noting how the characters "negotiate" (referring to Stuart Hall here, hence the quotes) their surroundings and read interpretations from other people, which shape how they represent themselves (Aech and Wade especially, but other too to some extent)
	- The above is particularly important when one considers the implications of the IOI Sixer's uniformity (or conformity); to be a Gunter is to be against the power structures, to be outcast. At the same time though, there is uniformity in the Gunter's non-conformity.
	- We need to start thinking about how exclusion is itself a form of inclusion--these oppositional modes are important for thinking about how themes operate to make the text mean something.

**Perspective:**

- The notion of perspective comes out of Point-of-View, something we've touched on frequently throughout the course as well. In *Ready Player One*, there are shifting perspectives in the narrative that we should account for in our analysis. 
- First, what does the narrative tell us about how the events are being interpreted?
	- As with *Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore*, the perspective of the narrator in *Ready Player One* in from the future--the events of the narrative have already transpired. This allows the narrator--nominally Wade, but sometimes Halliday--to potentially reinterpret or emphasize / exploit certain areas of the narrative for effect. 
	- One might ask: when does Wade choose his avatar? The name Parzival, as we are told, references the knight who gets ahold of the holy grail. Might the narrative perspective, coupled with the events of the story, and the significance of Wade's role in it allow us to push on the trustworthiness of Wade's account, particularly the symbology and the emphasis placed upon it in the story? Maybe. 
- Second, we might look at how the narrative designed to favour one perspective?
	- For instance, the narrator certainly favours the 1980s, as does the content and symbology of the novel.
	- As well, as noted above, the novel favours popular culture and the perspectives it offers on the past rather than say, High Art (what we find in museums) or Socio-Cultural Contexts (politics, nationalism, social movements, economics).
	- While socio-cultural contexts are mentioned, they are primarily mentioned as places characters must escape from--there is little offered in the way of interpretation; whereas the popular culture symbols and sidebars are worked over significantly.
- Third, there's the idea of perspective in gaming. What or how the player looks at the action and how this translates into how we "read" the text--how we visualize the action:
	- Some perspective types common to video games: MMORPG (The OASIS), First-person shooter, over-the-shoulder, fly on the wall, role playing.
	- Note how closely these perspectives resemble the modes in which we might interpret literature.

**Briskly (run through the text and see if you can find examples that will answer some of the questions posed below:**

**Power:**

- Who has it and why? Think about perspectives above: can we trust Wade's power position as narrator? What above Halliday? How does he hold onto power? 
- What about Sorrento and Morrow (and his dead wife)? What kind of power do they have and how to they wield it? 
- Power in the novel, at least form the perspective that we see it most of the time, is based on cultural capital. What about characters who do not have cultural capital? What happens to them? What are the implications of what's happening to them and what does this say about how we understand power?
- power in the novel is also based on esoteric knowledge--ignores real themes of humanity in favour of entertainment (note perspectives above). All the clues come not from deep contemplation about the nature of being, but from video games from the 1980s. 
	- Unlike the epic, the learning the characters do is not necessarily going to make you a better person or a better citizen. In fact, it might have the opposite effect, pulling people out of the public discourse in favour of "playing the game" (who's **not** playing?).
	- Think about how the book reinforces stereotypes about gaming at the same time as it holds games up as a significant metaphor for life in the near-future.

**History:**

- Think carefully, in light of everything above, about how the novel frames the 1980s. Watch some YouTube videos about the 1980s and see if you think the book gets it right. How and how not?
- The deployment of mythology, legend, and epic modes for story-telling. All the features of the epic are present in the novel--hero, quest, catalogues--as well as aspects of mythology--knights of the round table--and legend (as both metaphor (*The Legend of Zelda* and as recent history: the legend of Steve Jobs and its connection to Halliday's character)
- If, as most would argue, history and our understanding of it informs our behaviour, our ability to navigate the world, the what about the "made up" or "fictionalized" history in the novel? 
- How does the novel need to construct a history in order for it to work? 
- How is the history in the novel, stemming from the above, reflect a Western or "Euro-centric" worldview? What are the implications of such a position? How does *Ready Player One* colonize (look it up) the act of gameplay and/or its representation? 
- What is the role of video game history--or entertainment history--in the novel? How does this pressure our understanding of what history should be about? Is there room for this kind of pop-culture history? Is *TMZ* history?
