Lecture Module #10 - Intertextual Close Reading

On-Line Lecture #9

We're turning our attention toward writing the next essay (questions posted soon) and building a familiarity with some of the skills you might want to use in order to complete the essay. Try not to forget about the role of Stuart Hall's [Encoding / Decoding](http://digitalcultureslab.ca/douglascollege-online1102/winter2017/lecture-module-7/) and the role it plays in the final essay questions. You will need to have a steady grasp of Hall's reading process guidelines to really excel.  

Let's begin with a close reading of the first chapter of *Ready Player One*. Labelled "001," the first chapter has references to many specific things--characters, 1980s references, cultural artifacts. We want to start to catalogue these so that we can reflect upon how the symbolic meaning of these things builds as we progress through the novel. There are a few ways to go about this: 

1. Make a list of tangible things mentioned in the novel. Be very specific about what it is--no "aspects" or "areas"; name the actual thing to which you or the novel are referring. 
2. Assign a value to the things you have collected. Who is it important to--the answer here might be Wade, the audience, the reader, another character, the narrative sequence, allusion, or many other literary elements and expectations
3. Think next about how you know what you know in the novel. Who (character, narrator) or what (setting, symbol, metaphor, cultural reference) is helping you understand what's happening or interpreting things / people for you? How are they doing that? Why are they doing that? In short, we're thinking here about motivations--what is the motivation for making meaning the way it is being made?

As we work toward an interpretive paradigm--a way of "doing" the work of literary interpretation and writing about it, I want you to keep in mind the distinctions between "game" and "play":

Game:  

- rules
- order
- multiple players
- a distinct winner / loser
- repeated gaming is rewarded (you get better at it)
- specific location - board, screen, space

Play: 

- ad-hoc (no rules)
- anyone can join at any point and change direction of the group
- each individual brings their own take on the play (no rules to consult)
- no winner / loser (unfolds how it unfolds, where it unfolds)
- needs no "location" (largely imaginative), no reward for repeated play

Some other things to keep in mind: 

- Think about how objects function as symbols in games--what is representing what?
- Note the different types of games: Poker, Blackjack, Risk, Trivial Pursuit, to name a few
	- what do they have in common?
		- strategy game (Risk, Poker, Scrabble, etc.)
		- bluff game (Poker, Blackjack, Bridge)
		- intelligence game (Scrabble, Bridge)
		- pattern game (Crazy Eights, Cribbage, Bridge, First-Person Shooter)
		- Error game (Tic-Tac-Toe)
		- Role-playing Game (shooters, etc.)
- Expectations then fold into how we understand and play the game--much as they do when we read--genre--poetry, fiction, comic book, play--often determines our expectation, for example. 

How does our conception of "game" apply to thinking about character perspective and theme?

- Games often built around a central theme that does not change despite different strategies:
	- Clue = murder
	- Monopoly = money
	- Risk = War
	- Grand Theft Auto = Crime
- Objective is often to work within the theme in a different way in order to win the game
	- theme does not change but the attitude toward it does
	- Easter Eggs - repeated play or collaborative play

How then is interpretation like playing a game?
- There are rules, you need to play within them
- Rewards creative gameplay -- the ability to move within the rules toward new discovery
- Think about how the game discriminates and represents

Take a close look at two specific quotations from *Ready Player One*. What we're trying to do here is look for the implications these passages suggest for: 1) Wade’s character; 2) descriptive words used to describe women; 3) absent or coded references.

We want to focus our attention first on surfaces--what's going on, who's speaking, where are we in the novel--then we want to look underneath and think more deeply about the nature of the representation being offered. We want to ask questions such as these:
- What do these descriptions tell us about Wade’s biases, or how he sees the world?
- What are the words—exactly—that are used to describe; what do they signal about the character, what do they reveal? Do the terms suggest any particular way of “reading”—or making meaning in—the character
- What’s missing from the descriptions? What assumptions are we making as readers about the characters? (What’s the picture in our mind and how is that picture being put together?)

Here are the two quotes: “At the very top was a school photo of a young girl with a distinctly sad smile. To my surprise, she looked almost identical to her avatar. The same dark hair, the same hazel eyes, and the same beautiful face I knew so well—with one small difference. Most of the left half of her face was covered with a reddish-purple birthmark. I would later learn that these types of birthmark were sometimes referred to as ‘port-wine stains.’ In the photo, she wore a weep of her dark hair down over her left eye to try to conceal the mark as much as possible.” (291)“A heavyset African American girl sat in the RV’s driver seat, clutching the wheel tightly and staring straight ahead. She was about my age, with short, kinky hair and chocolate-colored skin that appeared iridescent in the soft glow of the dashboard indicators. She was wearing a vintage Rush 2112 concert shirt, and the numbers were warped around her large bosom. She appeared to be shivering, even though it was nice and warm in the cab.” (318)
