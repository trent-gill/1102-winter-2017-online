Lecture Module #7 - Poetry

It's a short lecture this week. Make sure you review the course modules for all the previous weeks of the course in preparation for the exam (more on that a little later). 

The readings you are responsible for in this module are below. They are also on the course schedule and **will not** be required for the mid-term exam. 

- Read [Poetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poetry), focusing on [poetic form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poetry#Form_in_poetry) and definitions for [Narrative Poetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrative_poetry) and [Epic Poetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_poetry)
	- You should be able to identify the characteristics that define the above
- Read William Gibson's long poem [*Agrippa*](http://www.williamgibsonbooks.com/source/agrippa.asp) and the [accompanying context pages](http://agrippa.english.ucsb.edu/category/the-book-subcategories/the-poem)
	- (Please read the above materials carefully. Understanding the context behind this poem is crucial for understanding the content)
- Read and [download this .pdf from Ishac Bertram](http://www.continentcontinent.cc/index.php/continent/article/view/97) that gives a few examples of "code poems"
- Read Elizabeth Bishop's poem ["Sestina"](http://allpoetry.com/poem/8493577-Sestina-by-Elizabeth-Bishop) 
- Read E. E. Cummings' poems ["r-p-o-p-h-e-s-s-g-r"](http://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poem/r-p-o-p-h-e-s-s-g-r) and ["1(a"](http://poetry-fromthehart.blogspot.ca/2011/06/ee-cummings-la.html)

We'll get to the key details in next week's module, but I want to emphasize and few themes you might want to explore in the above selections. One theme of interest is form. In poetry, form generally means the patterns that a poem uses to create effect or how the poem uses patterns to create effect. Poems are highly visual and they "compress" language, forcing a lot of meaning into a very tight space. In *Agrippa* for instance, the speaker in the poem is going through a photo album reflecting on the "mechanisms" that go into its construction (of the poem, of the photos and of memory). "r-p-o-p-h-e-s-s-g-r" on the other hand uses form as a way to visually represent a grasshopper's movement through the grass and the act of assembly that goes on as we read through the poem itself (from confusion to resolution to image). I want you to be very attuned to how these poems look, how they compact different meanings into language, and how they use form to help us visualize an imaginary (or real) space. 

To this end, think about how the poems build off the form of *JPod* and think about how *JPod* itself might rely on the conventions common to poetry. How might reading *JPod* poetically influence how we understand that novel? And, think carefully about how you visualize the activity of the poem. What are you visualizing? How does the form of the poem help you do that? (You might need to refresh your memory about stanzas, line breaks, and poetic conventions too!)

**Behind the Mask: Understanding Persona**

One of the most common devices used in poetry is that of a [persona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persona). Briefly, what we're looking at here is the way writers, or characters, hide behind masks. We want to think about how persona offers us a way to interrogate the role of the speaker without having to account for the motivations of authorship. It's an important concept that we'll be applying later. Make sure you understand what persona is and how it functions as a literary tool--you might think about how persona works with elements of criticism we have already encountered, such as character, setting, symbol, metaphor, intertextuality, and even cultural capital.

**Stuart Hall**

You were asked to read an explanation of Stuart Hall's ["Encoding and Decoding"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encoding/decoding_model_of_communication) essay. I'm going to speak more to the relevance of Hall's work in our next lecture, but for now read this to see how Hall's approach offers us a way of understanding and making "problematic" the act of reading. Often, we just assume what we are reading is what we are reading. We take at face value what we receive from a text. What Hall is trying to illustrate is that this "letting the meaning wash over us" is too simplistic. We bring to reading all our own biases, desires, and meanings. And, that we read in a directed way--we seek to confirm meaning, to understand things in our context, rather than to interpret meaning. 

To briefly break Hall's ideas down, there are three kinds of readers: 
		- Dominant
		- Negotiated
		- Oppositional
		
- **The dominant** reader decodes the text exactly as was intended. 
	- The dominant reading of a text is what most people would understand it to be about. The dominant reading tends to be surface, not inclusive of the other possible, or deeper, meanings.
- **The negotiating** reader decodes the texts by negotiating between the dominant reading and one that suits his / her own interests or aims. 
	- We frequently read texts this way; we believe most of what a character talks about, but something about how they say it for instance makes us suspicious of his/her motivations. 
- **The oppositional** reader can decode the dominant message, but chooses to reject that meaning because it doesn't really apply to his/her social, economic or cultural situation. 
	- Also known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resistant_reading" target="_blank">resistant reading</a>, the oppositional approach does things like question the representation of gender or sexuality and challenges the cultural assumptions represented in the text. 
	- We might apply an oppositional reading to a TV show like the <em>Brady Bunch</em> that idealizes a family dynamic, but at the same time seems to condone divorce. 
	- We might also perform an oppositional reading if we are not inclined toward heterosexuality--two cowboys in the isolation of the desert playing with each others guns or two women caressing each other's underwear in an advertisement might have entirely different possible readings than the intended literal meaning (if you're giggling right now over the last two examples, you're doing oppositional reading). 
	- Oppositional reading then still decodes the literal meaning, but it rejects it in favour of another perspective based on a different cultural, economic, or social viewpoint.

As I note above, we'll pick up on this in the next module. For now, make sure you have a handle on the three types of reading and the approach that marks each. 

Here's a great little video of Hall talking about his approaches:
