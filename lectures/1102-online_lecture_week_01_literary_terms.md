**Disclaimer:** 

The first two full modules in this course involve a lot of reading, I won't nag you, but please do make sure you have done the reading and have a good grasp of the key literary terms listed on the [course schedule](http://digitalcultureslab.ca/douglascollege-online1102/winter2017/course-schedule-and-readings-full/). Make sure you read the definitions of literary terminology carefully, and think about how you might use them to help you describe and explain how writing works to "make meaning." Otherwise, the lectures will not make sense--the lectures feed off your reading; they cannot be understood well in isolation from the readings. 

The activity prompts and Reader Response Blog Posts will invite you to apply some of the approaches and concepts in the lectures (like the one below). Try to apply the reading in the discussion threads and the blog posts as much as possible. You're learning in this course is a negotiation between the lectures and the application of the skill-sets, definitions, and approaches outlined therein to the other online spaces of the course.

**Why Call it a Text?**

In this course, we will often refer to the novel, poem, movie, song, game, etc., as a ["text."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_(literary_theory)) We won't usually call it a "novel" or a "poem" or "movie." We're doing this because we always want to move beyond the expectations of genre or literature to think about how reading helps us understand the world. Many of the interpretive strategies we'll use in the course apply to things outside literary study. As the Wikipedia link for "text" noted above suggests, "a text is any object that can be 'read,' whether this object is a work of literature, a street sign, an arrangement of buildings on a city block, or styles of clothing. It is a coherent set of signs that transmits some kind of informative message." Learning about the tools, processes, and approaches that allow us to interpret that message--and all its different modes (delivery, style, symbolism, assumptions)--is what this course is all about. 

For example, if you are a doctor diagnosing a patient, you does not simply declare: "you have the flu!!" That would be terrifying. Instead, we review symptoms by taking into account aspects of the patient's lifestyle (character traits), where she lives (setting), his body type (genre), habits, genealogy, his past, among many other things. Once we take into account all these particulars, and "read" the patient, we come to a diagnosis. We avoid generalized assumptions in favour or details, patterns, and potential contradictions.

One way to think about what we're doing in this course is to say: we're diagnosing meaning in texts. We don't necessarily want to restrict ourselves to thinking only about what a novel might mean. Or, we want to think about symbols, characters, settings that we see in texts as texts in-and-of-themselves--how they work on their own outside the novel or poem in which we encounter them. Point is, we're about details not about assumptions. By speaking to "texts," we hopefully eliminate some of the assumptions we make about genre and the act of reading; or at least we create a space to talk about some of those assumptions and why we make them. 

What we need to think about, and ultimately write essays, blog posts, and comments about, is how texts make meaning. Not what they *are* but what pieces make them up and how do these pieces add up to something (and what is the nature of that "something" anyway?).

**Making Meaning:**

Making meaning is something I will refer to often in this course. Essentially, I want to point you in the direction of analysis rather than synopsis. Often, we discuss the plot events of literary texts, or other cultural phenomena, as a way of trying to understand them. Discussing plot events is really about comprehension, which is something we need to do but that we need to move on from quite quickly. 

It's most important to figure out how a text "makes meaning." How does the text represent what it does? How does it make us feel things? How does it trigger an awareness in us? How does it make us sympathetic--or not--with particular characters?  

We often make assumptions about a text's meaning without really thinking about where that meaning comes from. Why, for instance, do we tend to like books that are "realistic"? What do we mean when we say that a text is realistic? What makes it so? What does it do that makes it appear realistic? Plots, or storylines, often are not realistic in the sense that most of us will not experience--or want to experience--what characters might experience. At the same time, we want to feel like we *could* experience things that the characters do; otherwise, it feels false. 

So, what we're interested in doing is determining what a text is about in order to understand how it makes meaning for readers. The way we can talk about this process is to use literary terminology, which gets us to label specifics. We need to discuss the specifics of [character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_(arts))--something the [activity prompt](http://digitalcultureslab.ca/douglascollege-online1102/winter2017/activity-prompt-2/) for this module, about Banksy, gets you to do. We also need to account for our expectations from the [genre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genre)--we don't expect a novel to read like a play; a poem to read like a novel. When we account for intricacies, as well as the assumptions we make about the [setting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Setting_(narrative)), or the locale in which the story is set, then we can address how the text makes meaning for us--how it delivers and diverts from our expectations.  

At the same time, we need to account for who is doing the speaking, or who has what [point-of-view](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narration#Narrative_point_of_view), in the novel or the poem or the play, or even the cultural statement--who are we, as an [audience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audience) focused on and to what ends? How does that speaker or point-of-view organize the events of the story; how do they structure the [narrative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrative_structure) to emphasize or foreshadow or minimize? How does the narrative emphasize the actions of one character over another? How does it contrast settings in order to convey different outlooks? 

When we combine the above approaches together, we get at the heart of how the text makes meaning. Take for example [Activity Prompt #1](http://digitalcultureslab.ca/douglascollege-online1102/winter2017/activity-prompt-1/), which asked you to visit a bookstore. That activity is all about understanding [setting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Setting_(narrative)) and how our expectations for the bookstore in *Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore* are set in motion by how the real world represents bookstores. Some of you loved the smell of bookstores. Reading *Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore*, we cannot actually smell the bookstore (even though there's a chapter titled "The Smell of Books" (63)), but somehow the description of the bookstore elicits that smell. How does it do that? Are there words that trigger that smell--what are those words? Is it the type of bookstore that is being described--how exactly is it described? How is your own love of the "smell of bookstores" creeping into your imagining of the bookstore--how does the book appeal to bookstore-lovers? How do other bookstores you've seen inform how you imagine *Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore*--how is the text play to your assumptions and expectations?

When we push a little further, we might discuss how *Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore* highlights a particular kind of bookstore. This isn't a *Chapters* or *Indigo* or *Barnes and Noble*. How is it different? What does that mean? How is the book foregrounding the *idea* or bookstores? How is it *idealizing* bookstores? What do the answers to these questions do to how we understand or imagine *Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore*?

Then, we can push even further: for those of you who do some reading on your kindle or iPad or equivalent. How is the "shelf" represented in your device? Why is it represented at all? It's not a real shelf, or is it? Even the books are rendered as "books." They have a "page flip." But, none of this is real. These things are all designed to "signal" real books in a virtual space. But, they didn't include a little scent-jet that shoots out the smell of books. Why not!?!? Why were the choices made the way they were--what emphasized or downplayed to "enhance your experience"?

These are some of the ways that a text--and the tools we use to read them--can enrich our understanding of the spaces we encounter in our everyday lives. Everything we encounter (people, places, objects) is to some degree being read by us, our assumptions, and our expectations. The trick we're trying to learn in this course is how to figure out where those assumptions and expectations come from, along with the different features of the literary texts (character, setting, genre, narrative structure, point-of-view) that manipulate or emphasize our assumptions and expectations as readers. How does the text make meaning?

**Specifics:**

As you can probably tell from the above, doing literary criticism is all about specifics. We need to avoid generalizations and work from specific examples. This practice is often referred to as [close reading](http://writingcenter.fas.harvard.edu/pages/how-do-close-reading). What we want to do is start with specifics--words, repetitions, and patterns--then make a claim about how those specifics work to make meaning. 

We wouldn't want as a starting point to say that Clay Jannon represents the stereotypical lazy hipster who does nothing all day. He might well represent such a thing, but we want details! What about him exactly makes him seem that way? What *words*, what *repeated actions*, what *symbols*? Once we establish all the elements that go into Clay's character, then maybe we might say that he is a lazy hipster who does nothing all day. We have examples to point to that allow us to make such a claim though; we're not just saying it.  

Once we do that, then we can do the other fun stuff: like suggest that his lazy hipster character is the perfect type to set out on a coming of age quest for knowledge. We're more sympathetic with him because he is a lovable loser. After we detail the bookstore, we might see how it stands in contrast to Google... but we would be able to analyze that contrast and see how it manipulates us to create suspense in the book. Or, how it prioritizes bookstores over technology from the beginning, foreshadowing the ending. 

There's lots of places to go with interpretation, and don't worry if you cannot get there right away. The real takeaway for this module is simply to understand that: 

- we use literary terms to focus our attention on details that make meaning in the text
- we need to use literary terms to help us describe how we are imagining the text
- we bring assumptions and expectations to a text, and we should account for that when we talk about what the text means
- we work with specifics--specific details from inside the text

Now, go and do [Activity Prompt #2](http://digitalcultureslab.ca/douglascollege-online1102/winter2017/activity-prompt-2/) (hint: it's all about how we understand--or try to understand--character).
