Lecture - Module 5

I have posted the following in Modules #5 and #6 to help give some context for writing Essay #1 and help us pivot toward a discussion of themes more broadly.  

- Acheson, Katherine O. "Close Reading: Prose Fiction" and "Aspects of Prose Fiction" *Writing Essays About Literature* (A Brief Guide For University and College Students) Ontario: Broadview, 2011.
- Howe, Elisabeth A. "Inventing Your Argument." *Close Reading: An Introduction to Literature.* Boston: Longman, 2010.

In this lecture, I will be speaking to *JPod* and some other important interpretive moves. Some of you might want to jump ahead and look at the lecture for Module #6 if you are wanting particular strategies for writing Essay #1. That said, what's in here is helpful for writing Essay #1, but on more of a contextual level than what's demonstrated in [Lecture #4 or Lecture #6](http://digitalcultureslab.ca/douglascollege-online1102/winter2017/category/lectures/)

One thing I want to highlight is that the most important facet of your essay should be the correctness of its grammar, syntax, diction (word choice), paragraphing, and argumentative logic. Make sure you are presenting writing that is the very best you can do. If I cannot read the essay or understand its content, I cannot give it a successful grade. Consult the course outline for more information about my expectations. I have no expectations about what might be a "right" or "wrong" answer to the essay question. However, I do have expectations for the written quality of the essay. Bottom line: if your writing is no good, you essay is no good. Spend some time editing and making sure that your writing is the best it can be before you submit.

I asked you to think about themes in the reading for this week's module. Here's a brief summary to hit the highlights and steer us toward deploying themes in the course. 

As the Wikipedia entry notes, themes are what we call the guiding subject in a text. By this I mean that themes are what we identify as the central subjects the text represents, distorts, or projects. I've added the terms represents, distorts, or projects because themes are sometimes present in texts in unusual ways. One of the central themes of *Jpod* for example is authorship, but I don't think the novel is about authorship so much as it comments upon it by distorting the role of the author in a text. As well, the text has numerous authors in it; all the characters write letters, synopses, and commentaries outside the confines of the story events. In short, a theme in *JPod* is how it *represents* authorship by *distorting* how we might understand (or *project*) the role of authorship. 

Most often, themes can be summarized in a single (maybe two), abstract, term(s). The two we've looked at so far for *JPod* are consumption and now authorship. There are certainly others: friendship, death, working life. What's important to understand about themes is that they are [abstract](https://www.google.ca/search?q=abstract%3A+define&oq=abstract%3A+define&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i58.5125j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8). We need to use the text to exemplify and explain those abstractions. If I were to ask you to give me an example of "love," each of us would have a different example. That said, we all sort of agree about what love means. In other words, we would know if the example *wasn't* love. This general, often tacit, agreement about what themes mean is what draws us to them in textual analysis. It's why we've been speaking a lot about assumptions in the course so far. How we understand themes is through assumptions--often correct--about what those abstract terms (love, hate, consumption, authorship) mean. What we're looking for, however, is how texts play with our assumptions or offer a different interpretation / representation of the abstract term. Hence our emphasis on close reading of the texts so far--we need to see how the text *exemplifies* the theme we think is relevant. 

The Wikipedia entry on themes also notes that themes are often binaries--conflicts. As is often the case, we often need this conflict to be engaged with the text. Simply, *Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore* is a novel about the binaries of old and new, technological and analogue. *JPod* is a novel about real and fake, contrived and genuine, capitalism and humanity. There's lots of themes, both as binaries and key terms. What's important for us is the we look at the examples to decipher *how* these themes are being represented, distorted, and projected, and *what* that tells us about ourselves, the machinations underlying the text, or the socio-political situations that govern the text's production.

Themes are ubiquitous. Every culture has themes, some of them are similar across races, religions, or castes. For instance, anyone can understand a theme such as loss, death, life. These themes are central to human existence. Themes get more complicated when it comes to examples such as power, race, religion, which have different interpretations or points of emphasis. Themes get even more slippery when we merge them or present them as binaries: race and power, religion and death, loss and life. 

The short of this is that because themes are abstract, they can be interpreted many ways and represented through many things--such as novels, poems, stop signs, drama, television, video games, advertisements, furniture, buildings, nationalism, language. You name it, there's a theme to it.  

The reason we have been learning all the literary terms we have been learning is so that we have some terminology through which to discuss themes. If we are going to speak to the theme of consumption in *JPod*, we'll need to find some examples in the text of Ethan consuming, or textual examples of food, or textual examples of sickness ("consumption" used to mean tuberculous). We find these examples in order to make a claim about, and this is the important point, how the text defines a particularly theme (or binary). 

- How does *JPod* define consumption?
- How does *JPod* define death? 
- How does *JPod* define friendship? 
- How does *JPod* define authorship?
- How does *JPod* distort the assumed binary between character and author in order to define storytelling? 
- How does *JPod* distort the assumed binary between literature and advertising in order to define the experience of popular culture?
- How does *JPod* project a representation of Vancouver that is understood differently by those who actually live in Vancouver in order to define the experience of an evolving metropolis? 
- How does *JPod* project as representation of working life that is at odds with our assumptions of success in order to define the hopelessness of technological optimism?

See how complicated we can get? The big takeaway here is that if we look in the text of *JPod* we can find examples, patterns of examples, characters, POVs, settings, metaphors, symbols, that will help us define how the text defines--and that is the work of critical analysis.

A few brief definitions in order to set up some ways of interpreting *JPod*:

1) [Intertextuality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intertextuality) or Allusion - the relationship between texts. Note that intertextuality can be intentional or accidental. As we move through the course, we'll want to be conscious of how the texts in this course might function as intertextual references. One way we've used intertextuality already in the course is to compare *Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour bookstore* to texts such as *Harry Potter* or *Lord of the Rings* or even *Seinfeld* all of which feature a group of people on the search for something, be it treasure, peace, or the correct mannerisms of certain situations (*Seinfeld* is obsessed with public mannerism and appropriate behaviour, something also present in *JPod*).

Point is, we always need to think about how other texts influence our reception of the text we are reading. That can mean other books we have read, what we know about grocery stores, or even our socio-cultural background and the stories we heard as children. Understanding themes means being accountable to the role of intertextuality in shaping our expectations--often so that those expectations can be subverted, but that's another lecture. 

2) [Cultural Capital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_capital) - the currency you possess that makes it easier to understand things such as allusion or intertextuality. We'll deal more fully with cultural capital later, but I want to introduce it now as a concept central to *Jpod*. What we know about advertising and the world of startup culture will influence how we receive *JPod*. If you live in Vancouver, you have more cultural capital (or currency) for visualizing the setting of the text (EA Games in Burnaby for instance is the obvious one). 

Point is, we should always be aware not only of our own cultural capital, but how cultural capital is exchanged in the text between characters or between reader and author. These spaces often nest assumptions about power, race, sexism, gender; the deeply-seeded assumptions that are the bedrock for our assumptions about themes.

As a last little bit, I'll leave you with this video of a Tesla driving itself. 

<center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V4PDTD2VHSU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>

Take note of how the video represents the action of the Tesla driving itself: the music, the speed, the "terminator-like" computer interfaces / cameras. (You can slow down the video by adjusting the playback speed in the lower right-hand corner.)

Think about the following: 

- How does it make incredible technological advances look mundane? (*JPod* makes high-paying, highly-skilled technology jobs look boring and unchallenging.)
- How does it make the car the focus (with its human characteristics) while also representing the absence of a human needed to drive the car?  (*JPod* makes humans into a resistance against the machinery of popular culture - irony is a defence-mechanism. How does this Tesla video undercut humanity by making humanity's absence ironic?)
- When you slow the video down, is it still exciting? (*JPod* interrupts our reading constantly, drawing attention to our reading, which is annoying, but its a great parallel for how we experience the world. Think about how texts from friends interrupt your workflow, or the multifarious presentation of Facebook's timeline, or commercial breaks on TV and YouTube.)
