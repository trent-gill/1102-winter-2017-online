Module 4 - Online Lecture

This week's module lecture is more a demo than a lecture. We're finishing up with *Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore* and moving into *JPod*, so a little pulling together is needed before we set off into the next text. If you've been following along with the lectures, doing the reading, and attempting the Activity Prompts, you should have a pretty good grasp of how literary terms are used to help examine how a text makes meaning. As we move through this week's online lecture, I want to reiterate how we can use literary terms to help us interpret texts. 

First off, literary terms such as character, narrative, metaphor, symbol, etc., are really about establishing our assumptions for what those things mean. At the same time, having definitions for these things allows us to visualize what a basic or "normative" character might be, or a "normative" symbol might look like. We read about a rose and think of love; see a black figure in a dark room and think something is about to happen that won't be good. In short, we need to establish our expectations--what we assume something will mean--and then see how that plays off what it means in the text. Sometimes, our expectations and the representations will align--as Gertrude Stein famously said: "a rose is a rose is a rose," suggesting there is sometimes no meaning beyond what we expect an object to be at face value. However, there are *often* times in a text where the representation and our expectation *do not* align. It's in these moments of non-alignment that we want to dive in. 

In order to recognize these spaces where representation and expectation don't necessarily align, we need to do some close reading--something the essay questions ask you to do. When we read closely, we avoid generalizing. However, we do need to account for our assumptions. 

As an example, here's a scene in *Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore* where Kat and Clay are chatting:

>“It was amazing,” Kat says. We’re sharing a gluten-free waffle in the Gourmet Grotto and she’s telling me about the inaugural gathering of the new Product Management. She’s wearing a cream-colored blouse with a daggerlike collar; underneath, her T-shirt winks red at her throat.  
  “Totally amazing,” she continues. “Best meeting ever. Completely … structured. You know exactly what’s happening all the time. Everybody brings a laptop—”  
  “Do people even look at one another?”  
“Not really. Everything that matters is on your screen. There’s an agenda that rearranges itself. There’s a back-channel chat. And there’s fact-checking! If you get up to speak, there are people cross-referencing your claims, supporting and refuting you—”  
   It sounds like an engineer’s Athens.  
“—and the meeting is really long, like six hours, but it feels like no time, because you’re thinking so hard. You get totally wrung out. There’s so much information to absorb and it comes so fast. And they—we—make decisions really fast, too. After somebody calls for a vote, it happens live, and you have to cast yours right away, or delegate it to someone else…”  
   Now it sounds more like a reality show. “Now it sounds more like a reality show. This waffle is terrible.
“There’s an engineer named Alex, he’s a big deal, he built most of Google Maps, and I think he likes me—he delegated his vote to me once already, which is pretty crazy, I’m brand-new—”  
I think I’d like to delegate my fist to Alex’s face.  
   “—and there are tons of designers, more designers than usual. Somebody said they tweaked the selection algorithm. I think maybe that’s why I got in, because I’m a designer and a programmer. It’s an optimal combination. Anyway.” She finally takes a breath. (200-1)  

Now, let's extract all the parts where Clay interjects, verbally and mentally, into Kat's recounting of her experience: 

- We’re sharing a gluten-free waffle in the Gourmet Grotto and she’s telling me about the inaugural gathering of the new Product Management. She’s wearing a cream-colored blouse with a daggerlike collar; underneath, her T-shirt winks red at her throat.   
- “Do people even look at one another?”  
- It sounds like an engineer’s Athens.  
- Now it sounds more like a reality show. This waffle is terrible.
- I think I’d like to delegate my fist to Alex’s face.  
- She finally takes a breath.

Ask yourself: is Clay listening to Kat? How is he interpreting Kat's words for us, commenting on her story, giving us his read on what she is saying, how we should receive the story, how we should be listening to what Kat is saying? What's interesting is how the above reveals the Point-of-View or "focalization" of the narrative is running through Clay's interpretation. In other words, it's interesting that Clay undercuts Kat's enthusiasm with a disdainful commentary that for us readers negates her success. He kind of cuts her down in his asides, minimizes her success, concentrates our attention on superficial characteristics--her clothes (the red shirt), words such as "dagger-like," he hates her waffle, he's jealous, she's babbling not breathing. Take a look at Clay's commentary... what of it refers to what she's actually saying. In fact, he's judgey right of the bat asking, "Do people even look at one another?" It encapsulates his disdain for technological situations before he has even learned the lesson at the end of the book--that sentence is "future Clay" speaking, focalizing the narrative through his position in the past and making himself out to be the sage.   

Now, on the one hand, I think most of us read Kat as a pretty accomplished woman in the novel. She's smart, has a great job, is advancing in that job--a very competitive space--and she generally has skills and initiative so far beyond Clay's it's laughable to compare them. We root for Kat and we admire her as a role model for success. 

On the other hand, Kat's power is consistently negated in the text. She is constantly undercut (her food is weird, she's weird, she's too smart), objectified (so much concentration on the red shirt--do you remember what Clay is wearing? Neel? Penumbra?), and undermined by Clay (she's overly optimistic, obsessed by crazy things, ungrounded, not interested in *him*). Kat is undermined by Clay both through his narrative interjections and in the way he presents her character. He gets us to focus on superficial aspects of Kat's character and undermines the exceptional aspects of her character. Kat is at once symbolic of a successful woman and *symbolized* as a naïve waif who is super-smart, but overly-driven, unenlightened, often tolerated because she is cute. Clay consistently mocks Kat to the reader, pointing to her faults and the foibles of her technological optimism throughout the text, while remaining self-referentially aloof about his own short-comings. Clay's shortcomings are endearing where Kat's are annoying. Clay's shortcomings are depicted as enlightened self-reflection and established stasis where Kat's shortcomings are depicted as self-serving optimism and self-centred career advancement negotiated through a red T-shirt.

Here's a few more examples where Kat is represented by Clay in a way that undercuts her empowerment:
	
>It's finally time to break a code that has waited five hundred years.  
	Kat has requisitioned Google’s data visualization amphitheater with its massive screens. She’s moved tables from the lunch tent into position down in front; it looks like mission control, picnic-style.  
	The day is beautiful; a sharp blue sky is dotted with wispy white clouds, all commas and curlicues. Hummingbirds hover down to investigate the screens, then zip back out across the bright open lawns. There’s music in the distance; the Google brass band is practicing an algorithmically generated waltz.   
	Down below, Kat’s handpicked code-breaking squad is setting up. Laptops are coming out, each one encrusted with a different collection of colorful stickers and holograms, and the Googlers are plugging into power and fiber optics, flexing their fingers.  
	Igor is among them. His brilliance at the bookstore earned him a special invitation: today, he’s allowed to play in the Big Box. He’s leaning in to his laptop, his skinny hands a bluish blur, and two Googlers are watching wide-eyed over his shoulder.  
	Kat is making the rounds, conferring with Googlers one by one. She smiles and nods and pats them on the back. Today, she’s a general, and these are her troops.” (222-3)  

Here, Clay compares Kat to a general, giving her a small leadership role but connecting it metaphorically with Warfare. Not sure Kat would like that comparison. Note too the set up, a kind of garden of eden, all innocence and optimism that will of course come crashing down when Kat ultimately fails. It's "mission control" but "picnic-style" reducing Kat's attempts to think differently back to symbolic connections to housewives, kitchens, food preparation, picnics are not work. Again, Clay concentrates on superficialities: stickers, plugging in. He empowers Igor, who has the rapt attention of the Googlers, because he's "brilliant" where Kat is "making the rounds." Kat's a cheerleader where Igor, in a very brief description, is brilliant and popular for his brilliance.  

Note how the military metaphor continues as the text moves through the scene:

>“Kat is grinning. She’s an artillery officer who’s just gotten her hands on a really big gun. Now she looks up at her audience—the fellowship. She cups her hands around her mouth: “That was just the warm-up!”  
There’s a countdown splashed across the screens. Giant rainbow numbers go 5 (red), 4 (green), 3 (blue), 2 (yellow) …
And then, on a sunny Friday morning, for three seconds, you can’t search for anything. You can’t check your email. You can’t watch any videos. You can’t get directions. For just three seconds, nothing works, because every single one of Google’s computers around the world is dedicated to this task.  
Make that a really, really big gun. (227-8)  

At this point, we have to ask: what's with all the guns? Well, guns are often a phallic symbol, so that's something. Guns are certainly something that suggests empowerment, but this is a strange sort of empowerment. The Big Box is a metaphoric gun, it cannot actually shoot anything, can't fire, can't kill. And yet, Clay continually depicts Kat as a military general: a dominating, somewhat shallow individual, who will win at all costs. 

At this point, let's jump back to an earlier scene in the text where Kat and Clay again meet over food that Clay needs to judge:    

>“I don’t see Kat for almost two weeks. She’s busy organizing everything for the Great Decoding, and busy with other Google projects, too. The Product Management is an all-you-can-eat buffet, and she’s hungry. She hasn’t replied to any of my flirty emails, and when she texts me, her messages are two words long.  
	Finally, we meet on Thursday night for a desultory date over sushi. It’s cold, and she’s wearing a heavy houndstooth blazer over a thin gray sweater and a shiny blouse. There’s no sign of her red T-shirt anymore.  
	Kat gushes about Google’s projects, all revealed to her now. They are making a 3-D web browser. They are making a car that drives itself. They are making a sushi search engine—here she pokes a chopstick down at our dinner—to help people find fish that is sustainable and mercury-free. They are building a time machine. They are developing a form of renewable energy that runs on hubris.	  
	With each new mega-project she describes, I feel myself shrink smaller and smaller. How can you stay interested in anything—or anyone—for long when the whole world is your canvas?” (209)

In this case, the focalization is entirely in Clay's mind. He's not saying anything out loud. Note how much of this text is about Clay being neglected, not Kat's success. He undermines her by making off-hand comments related to food (why food?) He laments the loss of her red t-shirt. He describes her speech as "gushes," snidely refers to "hubris." He's so wrapped up in how *he* feels smaller and smaller that he doesn't see that Kat is getting bigger and bigger. 

The result of this focalization is that we tend to sympathize with Clay. We feel sorry for him. We react more to his sorrow that we do to Kat's success. In so doing, we don't yell at Clay for being lazy, for not applying himself, for not doing anything. He's no general; he's no snappy dresser; he doesn't gush.  

When we finally get to the end of the text, when Clay will reveal the code he has broken, we get another depiction of Kat that undermines her and, in a final blow to the validity of her character, allows Clay to get his revenge, his comeuppance for her technological optimism:

>“Kat is here, sitting up front, way off to the side, talking quietly with Mat and Ashley. She’s wearing her houndstooth blazer again. There’s a green scarf around her neck, and she’s cut her hair since the last time I saw her; now it stops just below her ears.  
We are no longer dating. There has been no formal declaration, but it’s an objective truth, like the atomic weight of carbon or the share price of GOOG. That didn’t stop me from pestering her and extracting a promise to attend. She, of all people, has to see this." (269)

Note the pattern again: Clay speaks to Kat's clothing, then moves into how she makes *him* feel. He ends the description by suggesting that "She, of all people, has to see this." Think carefully about the meaning behind this phrase. Is it nice? Why does *she of all people* have to see it? The implied answer is that she needs to see it because she needs to check herself with all the technological hubris and see that books are really valuable and that technology can't solve our problems, good old-fashioned investigative research will solve our problems--Clay will solve our problems. She needs to be put in her place. 

The final depiction of Kat in the novel, runs as follows: 

>“Kat will climb the ranks of the PM. First she’ll bring Google the decoded memoir of Aldus Manutius, which will become the cornerstone of a new Lost Books project. The New York Times will blog about it. Next, the acquisition of Anatomix and the popularity of Google Body will give her even more momentum. She’ll have her picture printed in Wired, a whole glossy half page, standing under the huge data visualization screens, hands on her hips, blazer hanging loosely over her bright red BAM! T-shirt.  
>I will realize then that she never stopped wearing it after all.”

Note the pattern. She's now associated with books and the body--two things that, as we discussed early on in this course, are often thought-of as female activities--men are too busy fighting wars and being Generals. And, thankfully for Clay, she never really left the red t-shirt behind to become professional.  

Now, based on that close reading of Clay's portrayal of Kat, I want to make a few generalizations about what *Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore* means. Clay represents male empowerment and the urge to maintain that empowerment in the face of inevitable change. Kat represents the potential for female empowerment--the ability to lead and configure change, to find new venues and approaches that will lead to new ways of thinking, new ways of understanding. She's a metaphor for changing technology, she's mobile, malleable, fast, adaptable, uncomfortable, and optimistic. Clay is a metaphor for established--one might say entrenched--technology, unchanging, unmalleable, stuck, certain, slow, safe, comfortable. 

What *Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore* represents then, other than the battle between old and knew technologies, old and new knowledge, is the active repression of female empowerment by a male establishment. Kat's character is represented in a way that does not allow for her success or even her mobility outside the confines to established or entrenched norms. At every turn the reader is turned toward typical female characterizations: superficialities, irritating ticks, fashion choices, food, gesture. In the end, Kat's failure is the impetus for Clay's success. Her defeat is his victory.

Phew. There's your close reading. A few important takeaways:

- Nest yourself in specific references to the text, in any order, where there are examples to explain and draw from.
- Look for patterns, what do these patterns mean, how do they work, what do they emphasize, focus our attention on? 
- Read for surfaces first, then plunge into the depths (this is very important to remember when reading *JPod*).
- Generalize at the end, after you have presented the specifics. 
- Make suggestions about what the specifics mean for our assumptions--ALWAYS ACCOUNT FOR YOUR ASSUMPTIONS
- Begin by examining your own assumptions
	- if you are not White, how come you visualize Clay as White? What assumptions are you making about the text?
	- Why did you predict the ending as you did? What kept you reading? 
	- Which character did you identify with most? Why? 
- Do not generalize!! *Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore* is a text that has particular details that represent digital culture. It does not, in and of itself, represent digital culture.
- The text should be used to exemplify places where you assumptions or expectations are met and diverged from. DO NOT EXPLAIN THE TEXT, EXPLAIN HOW OR WHAT IT MEANS TO YOUR ASSUMPTIONS OR EXPECTATIONS.
- Avoid, always, explaining the plot, or recounting events. USE the text as evidence not as something that needs to be reviewed in sequence, that's not interpreting meaning; that is reviewing meaning. 
- Book titles need to be in italics. Events in a text take place in the present tense. You write about and reference examples from the text in the present tense. You speak to the textual object itself--the book / poem / play / stop sign--in the past tense. I.e.: The play *Hamlet* **takes place** in Elsinore, Denmark where it **is** set, but the play **was written** in 1603 / Stop signs **have been** around for some time, this is the first I've seen that actually **says** "Stop" through a loudspeaker when I approach an intersection.
- Unlike what's above, your examples from the text should not be set-off, or in italics. They should be "in quotations and follow the order of your punctuation" (112). Consult an MLA style manual for more. The quotations look the way they do here because of the internet--they're not correctly formatted.

As a final bit of levity, below is a nice example of how a close reading of things can get out of hand:
