Writing Tips - Essay #2


**The Principle for Applying Pattens of Analysis**

While I usually hesitate to suggest that there is a rubric or scaffolding for writing essays, particularly about literature, I want to speak to some of the expectations for critical analysis. There a particular characteristics common to most effective essays that apply the text to make a comment about themes. 

First up: remember that your job is to recognize and show patterns of meaning in the text and then offer an interpretation about what those patterns mean (or how they "make meaning"). Your job is not to show me that you have read the novel or to make some awkward suggestion about how "effective" or "good" it is at something (or how clever the author is).

Your thesis then should offer that interpretation of patterns in the text. You should make a claim about how the book defines a theme such as power or identity or reality or history. You should not necessarily move through the text chronologically, or linger over plot events and character assumptions. Doing so gets at "what" the text is about rather than "how or why" it offers a definition of a theme. We should be focused on the "how and why" of the text not the "what." What the text does or what it means is pretty easy stuff--high school level analysis. What we're after now, in College or University contexts--is to apply our thinking to see *how and why* the text works the way it does.

To this end, we **USE** the text as an example or evidence. We *apply* the text, and particularly the patterns within it, to reinforce our interpretation--or definition of--a theme (or idea, or representation). To put this plainly: we are writing about how features (textual evidence of repeated *things* (words!) or *actions* (words!) or *representations* (sentences!)) work in the text. What do these patterns of repetition teach us about how we understand power? How we define identity? How we us history? How we understand reality? 

A good essay at this level is never five paragraphs long. Instead, it follows a pattern of development by building upon the main claim or intervention. For instance, you might suggest that reality in *Ready Player One* is made up of narratives common to popular culture and thus defines reality as a form or entertainment rather than a place of real meaning. You would then need to find some examples in the text that show reality defined through popular culture and show how those examples reinforce your claim--make it believable. You might have one paragraph introducing the claim or intervention (thesis at the end of the paragraph); then, you might show four examples in four paragraphs (or more) where references to movies appear and explain how those examples reinforce your claim above. You would explain how and why the features (words!) used to describe the movies focus on entertainment value rather than deeper questions (more paragraphs). Each example would eventually allow you to show a pattern for representing movies in the text and how that pattern of representation confirms your claim (a concluding paragraph). 

Note that in the above, you would not speak to all popular culture (movies and games and music, etc.) in the text; instead, you pick *only one* very specific element of popular culture and work through the textual examples to reinforce your claim. Avoid making generalized claims about main characters for example; if you are working through a character, only pick one not two or three. Point is, you need to deal with specific features in the text. If you don't deal with specifics, patterns will not reveal themselves because the approach is too broad and dispersed.

**The Rubric**  

Your first paragraph should make a suggestion about how and why the approach you have chosen (usually given by the question) is important. For instance, why is this essay of value? What's important in here? What's in it for your reader? What will they know about the text at the end of the essay that they do not know now? (Remember, they have read the text!!). Your first paragraph should end with a thesis.

When it comes to the body of your essay, think in segments. Each segment might have multiple paragraphs. In the table below, each row might need a paragraph or, two rows might make a paragraph, and so on. When yo turn in a new direction, start a new paragraph. Each segment should approach one piece of evidence or, similar groupings of evidence. Finally, the segments should be organized not by where the evidence appears in the text, but by how effectively your evidence confirms your intervention (claim or thesis). Following this logic then, If your best evidence comes from the beginning of the text, it should appear at the end of your essay. 

|What You Need  | Notes and Explanations |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Topic Sentence     | Introduce the topic for the segment, explain what it is you intend to do (or analysis), why it is important to do so, and how it reinforces the intervention or argument offered by the thesis                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Evidence           | Get to your evidence early. Make sure the evidence is a direct quote from the text (or a fairly brief summary or an event). Your job as a critical thinker is to demonstrate that you can apply the text and show how patterns in the text mean something -- or make meaning.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Analytical Context | Frame the evidence and explain *how and why* you think the evidence is important. Does it represent a pattern or part of a pattern that is important for representing a theme? What are the features of the pattern (character, setting, POV, symbol, etc.)? What does the pattern in the textual evidence show us about how the text makes meaning or represents a theme such as history, power, identity, or reality. *How and why* does the text define the theme in question? What are the features (symbol, character, setting, etc.) in the text that help to define the theme?    |
| Summarize          | Explain how and why *your analysis* above diverges from, agrees with, or resists standard definitions of the theme in question. Or, how your choice of evidence sheds light on how *the text* manipulates, confirms, or resists definitions of the theme. (This is where Stuart Hall's work comes in handy...)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Transtion          | Transition into the next segment by showing how all the above works to confirm your claim or intervention about how the text makes meaning. Prepare to build on this segment in the next by showing how your topics (or main points) work together.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

Your conclusion should "flip" the introduction, offering a reframing of the thesis in light of the reader's journey through your paper. How has the addition of evidence reinforced or focused your claim? What more do we know now that we didn't when we started reading the essay? What has changed about how we see the text?

**A Point-Form Application of the Approach Noted Above**

If I were writing an essay where I was asked to make a claim about how reality "worked" in *Ready Player One*, this is what it might look like. Note that I am paying attention to how the question is framed: it asks "how" reality *works*. In other words, **not what** is it in the text, **but how and why** does it **do something**. That's a big hint about what the instructor wants to see in your essay. Not what is reality, but how does it *do something*, how does it *work*? The first thing I need to do is figure out how reality does something to something else--how it impacts or *works* upon something. And this is where the literary terms from the first half of the course come in handy: how does it work on *setting*? How does it work on *a character*? How does it work on a *symbol*? And so on. As well, I think about Stuart Hall and I wonder how I "negotiate" the reality I live in or how I "negotiate" to understand the reality represented in the book. I ask: what kind of reality are we reading in the book and how might I describe that reality? 

From here, I might open a dictionary--BUT NEVER QUOTE FROM IT--and look up "reality" and see what the features are in a common definition. I might think about how we have discussed reality in the course, and how we framed that discussion in earlier texts. Then, I get to it: I scan the novel looking for examples where reality is featured. And I find one: 

>"My appearance was part of the problem. I was overweight, and had been for as long as I could remember. My bankrupt diet of government subsidized sugar-and-statch-laden food was a contributing factor, but I was also an OASIS addict, so the only exercise I usually got back then was running away from bullies before and after school. To make matters worse, my limited wardrobe consisted entirely of ill-fitting clothes from thrift stores and donation bins--the social equivalent of having a bull's-eye painted on my forehead." (Cline 30-1)
 
- First up, I want to bring in a theme and situate the passage in reference to the novel:
	- One of the few areas of the book that references Wade's time outside the OASIS. At the same time, it provides context for understanding one of the major themes of the novel: alternate realities. 
- After signalling the theme and situating the passage, I look for a thesis that narrows the concept or alternate realities or at least makes a move toward why that theme is significant:
	- In particular, *Ready Player One* suggests that alternate realities represent a way of improving the lives of those who exist on the fringes of normal society.
- Note how I bring key terms forward, helping the reading understand how my ideas are unfolding and providing a significance for alternate realities--I can explain why that theme is important. 

- Now, moving into the main portion of the paper, I need some things. So, I list them in a call and response fashion. I state an interpretation, based on an example from the passage; then, I respond to that with a possible oppositional reading. Then, I move to a conclusion or nod to significance about the call and response:
	- Because he is fat and poor, Wade is socially awkward outside the OASIS--the alternate reality is a safe-haven. 
	- Wade is somewhat socially awkward inside the OASIS as well; he wouldn't attract the individuals that he does (those on the fringes) if he wasn't marginalized. 
		-  Wade's descriptions of himself outside the OASIS are carried forward into the OASIS and register with the reader's expectations for marginalized groups. The alternate reality provides a safe-haven for Wade, but in that alternate reality, he none-the-less attracts people who are "like him" in the outside world. While the OASIS is a space where Wade can re-set his representation, ultimately he still attracts the social fringes that he belongs to in the "real world." 

- I would continue to work through questions of how he i marginalized, or how the alternate reality of the OASIS marginalizes Wade:
	- Does the alternate reality give him free pass on health issues such as addiction and obesity?
	- Does emotional health--friendships, and belonging--trump physical health? 
		- The reader allows Wade flexibility they wouldn't allow him were he not marginalized, for instance.

The point here is that I locate myself in the example that the passage provides, I draw off consistent key terms that emerge out of a theme, and I stick to one topic area showing the dichotomies that exist in the representation and the reading. The important piece of this essay is making sure that there's an oppositional reading and that there are **THINGS** in the passage that you can point to as symbolic or representative of a **THING**.

**Some Common Errors**  

**Generally:**  

Please remember that the essay question is part of curriculum requirements. It is not some separate animal. The essay questions are designed to make you deploy the stuff we have been talking about and working through in the course for the last three months. I'm looking to see how you are applying the concepts of the course. And, if you haven't read the text or done the work, this will show in the essay. Essays are not supposed to be free-for-all creative spaces for you to make generalized claims about the text and its value. Essays are a way of assessing whether or not you can apply the curriculum and whether or not you have read the texts thoughtfully. So, if you haven't kept up with the curriculum, read the texts, or asked questions when you don't understand something, you'll find completing the essay questions difficult. If you've done all the work, then FEEL CONFIDENT that you are doing the best you can. I'm not expecting perfection or genius, just thoughtfulness with a focus on the text and how you demonstrate the outcomes intended by the curriculum AS YOU SEE THEM. 

**Specifically:**  

One of the most common errors in student papers about literature is a tendency to avoid naming or identifying tangible examples:

- Wrong: The passage I have chosen is compelling because it is symbolic of something has happened.

- Right: The passage's main symbol is the OASIS, which is an alternative reality. OR: Wade's reference to his ill-fitting clothes from thrift stores and donation bins" shows him to be symbolic of marginalized groups on the fringes of normal society.

Avoid stating things in an opaque or unclear way, cut to the point: 

- Wrong: The context that gives the passage its meaning is missing.

- Right: While it alludes to the idea of individuality, the passage cloaks it in descriptions of that individuality as it is marginalized identity: Wade is excluded and separated, the target of exclusion; his appearance is "part of the problem" (Cline 30).

Avoid big, catch-all words that don't point to actual examples in the text:

- Wrong: There are components of the passage that suggest important aspects in other areas of the novel.

- Right: The references to "ill-fitting clothing," appearances, and a general feeling of being bullied, help the reader understand how loneliness and exclusion--both major contexts for understanding Wade's character--work to provide the bedrock for Wade's motivation for finding the golden key. 

All this noted, **the most important thing** you can do is pay attention to your sentence structure, the formal elements of the paper, and the clarity with which you present your ideas. Each of the examples above works because they speak to actual things and make direct reference to the text. But, the bottom line is that if I cannot read what you are writing, if I cannot understand what you are trying to get across, if it is clear that you are fulfilling a quota without really caring whether or not what you are saying is of interest and meaningful, that's bad for your grade. If you are not taking the time to adequately proofread and acknowledge the requirements spelled out clearly in the course outline and on the question sheet, then your grade will be impacted negatively.  

Try to remember, deep in your heart, that I am not some idiot trying to make you care about what you don't need to care about. However, I am still responsible for making sure that you meet the requirements of the curriculum and leave the classroom with the requisite skills. If you can't demonstrate mastery over those skills, then you cannot pass. It's not personal, it's my responsibility. So, take the time to show me that you deserve to get a decent grade; don't just expect a decent grade by some miracle of happenstance.
