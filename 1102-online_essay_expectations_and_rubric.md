**Essays:** The course will require two take-home formal essays. In order to pass--a grade of P--the course, students must submit both essays. Topics for the essays are listed below and a separate question sheet will be made available on the class website or by request. Take-home essays should be typed, double-spaced, in a legible 12pt font, with minimum 1 inch margins and be formatted as noted in the course policies above--in MLA style with a title, proper in-text citation and a work(s) cited page. They should be submitted via Email and include your name in the file name as noted in the policies above. 

For those of you unfamiliar with the requirements of an English course, please remember that good writing is imperative for a positive assessment. Essays should include a relevant thesis statement supported by exposition that is clear and logical. Errors in sentence structure, argumentative logic and grammar, spelling, etc., will affect your grade negatively. Take the time to proof-read your work for typos, formal problems and logic. Keep an extra copy of all essays (except those written in exam booklets). It is your responsibility to provide a copy of your essay--or other work--should it go missing.

*A- through A*: The content exceeds expectations of the prompt. It is focused and coherently integrates examples with explanations or analysis. It demonstrates awareness of its own limitations or implications, and it considers multiple perspectives when appropriate. It reflects in-depth engagement with the selected text, and the argument is persuasive.

*B- through B+*: The content meets expectations of the prompt. It is focused and coherently integrates examples with explanations or analysis. It demonstrates some awareness of its own limitations or implications, and it considers multiple perspectives when appropriate.
