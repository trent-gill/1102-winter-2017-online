**English 1102 (Online) Activity Prompt #5 - Week 5  
Complete by Feb. 8th

**Outcomes Statement:** This activity prompt is designed to get you thinking about how *JPod* uses intertextuality to introduce and describe situations, characters, or interactions.

**Task:**

Sometime before February 8th, write up a letter to your favourite (I use this term loosely) popular culture food icon. The icon **can't** be Ronald McDonald, but it could be Wendy, The Burger King, The Pillsbury Doughboy, Captain Crunch, An endless number of Rabbits, Snap, Crackle, or Pop (or all three), Aunt Jemima, Uncle Ben among other racist icons, and so on. 

You should use "Douglas Coupland's" (in quotes because I am speaking about the character, not the author) letter to Ethan on page 300 of *JPod*, beginning "Ethan, thanks for telling me about your life and everything. It's intriguing..." as a model. Write a letter to your favourite food icon that tries to make a judgement upon his/her character (nothing too cruel, and really think about what you are saying).    

Some things to think about:

1. What's the tone you are taking? 
2. How do you visualize you food icon? What basis to you have for her humanity? 
2. How do your expectations for the food the icon represents influence how you chose the icon and the content of your letter to her?
3. What examples do you refer to in your letter? Why those examples? How are they representative of the food the icon represents? 
4. *How* does the icon appeal to you? Speak to some characteristics that the icon possesses and explain what you find valuable or off-putting about them. Why are you intrigued by the icon? Why are you connected to the icon? 
6. How does *JPod* work to exploit our knowledge of popular culture icons to create meaning?

**Notes:**

The above activity is trying to demystify the act of interpretation. If we stick with trying to understand *what* we are experiencing in *JPod* rather than the *why* we are experiencing it, the text has some interesting things to say about the nature of consumption, authorship, consumerism, and popular culture (all themes!). We don't have to read texts looking for reasons why they were written, or authorial motivations. Most of the time, we need to read them to see how they represent the experience of living--whether we have lived that way of not. Again, it's all about what you visualize and how you visualize--or imagine--the text in your head. Try to think about how that image in your head comes to be and what it might mean. If you're confused, what is it that's making you confused in the text? When are you not confused? Then, examine the differences to get at what the text is trying to represent (it might be confusion!). If you took all the scenes in *JPod* where characters are writing letters, what could you say about how the text "makes meaning" and comments on the nature of representation, the role of figures (icons) who represent things to / for us, and our interaction with them or communication more generally between ourselves?
