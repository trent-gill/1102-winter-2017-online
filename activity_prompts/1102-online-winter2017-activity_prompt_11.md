**Outcomes Statement:** This activity prompt is designed to get you started writing your second essay.

**Task:**

You will need: 

1. The [essay questions](http://digitalcultureslab.ca/douglascollege-online1102/winter2017/essay-2-questions/) for essay number 2.
2. A pen and a piece of paper
3. Your cell phone or a kitchen timer
4. 45 minutes of free, uninterrupted, time

Start by setting yourself up in a quiet space, free of distractions. Put your phone in "do not disturb mode" and set the timer for twenty (20) minutes and start it. Take a look at the [essay questions](http://digitalcultureslab.ca/douglascollege-online1102/winter2017/essay-2-questions/) for twenty minutes. Read over the questions carefully, and the instructions. If you finish reading before the twenty minutes is up, then keep reading until the timer goes off. **Do not stop reading the essay questions until the timer goes off.**

Now, reset your timer for ten (10) minutes and start it. Write freely on your piece of paper about what you have just read on the question sheet. Don't think too much about how you are answering the questions--or even which one. Just reflect on the questions and the reading you have done and respond on the piece of paper. Don't stop to think, just keep writing for ten minutes. No breaks, no stopping, no thinking. If you drift into other thoughts that's fine, keep writing and try to seamlessly steer yourself back to the essay questions. **Keep writing, everything, until the timer goes off.**

Now, reset your timer for fifteen (15) minutes and start it. Read over what you have written **out loud--no mumbling, enunciate!** As you are reading aloud, stop and edit out, by crossing out only, those areas of the writing that are not relevant to the essay questions. You can delete, and add a few words here and there, but try to avoid writing entirely new sentences, work with what you've got. Keep going until the timer goes off, even if it means running through things again and again. **Do not stop until the timer goes off.**

Post the results--without editing further--to the Class Discussion forum. Comment on what others have written.
