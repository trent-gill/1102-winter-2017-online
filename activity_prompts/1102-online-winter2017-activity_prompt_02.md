**English 1102 (Online) Activity Prompt #1 - Week 2  
Complete by Jan. 18th   
Winter 2017 - Douglas College - David N. Wright**  

---

**Preamble**

This is the second in what will usually be a weekly "activity prompt" that I include in the course module to get the discussion thread going. These activity prompts are for everyone in the course to complete and discuss on the discussion thread for the week's course module. You will need to be able to discuss what you learned from completing the activity prompt, especially how it influenced your reading of the texts we'll be covering in the course. Suffice to say, most will find it extremely helpful to approach these activity prompts with a degree of formality:  

1. Write down your responses to the activity prompt's questions
2. When completing the activity prompt, always relate your thinking to the text(s) we're covering--don't just "do it," think about how the activity is enhancing--or detracting--from your experience of reading, interpretation, or understanding literary effect (character traits, symbols, metaphors, atmosphere, etc.).
3. If you cannot physically complete the prompt, imagine what it would be like to do it and come up with responses based on how you imagine the experience of completing the activity prompt. 

As I note in the course outline and expectations, I will set up a weekly discussion thread in Blackboard to facilitate discussion around the activity prompt. I'll check in on the discussion thread once or twice a week and discuss the activity prompts with those who are in the thread. Alternatively, you can discuss the activity prompts amongst yourselves--or take the conversation in another direction of more interest to you--by setting up your own discussion thread (check the Blackboard tutorials if you want help doing this).

**Outcomes Statement:** This activity prompt is designed to get you thinking about [Character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_(arts)) and how literary devices rely on our cultural assumptions--our learned assumptions about the world--to make meaning. Make sure you have read the lecture for week one, and done all the required readings about literary terms on the [course schedule](http://digitalcultureslab.ca/douglascollege-online1102/winter2017/course-schedule-and-readings-full/) before you enter into the discussion thread.

**Task:**

Sometime before January 18th, do some research (on the internet mostly) on the artist called Banksy. Spend some time--maybe an hour or so--and read the Wikipedia page, look at the art, read some statements, feel your way around the different contexts, following links as your curiosity, and time, allows. 

Banksy is anonymous, but does have a particular style. What personality traits do you imagine when you picture Banksy? Make a list of the character traits you see when you visualize Banksy and share at least three of those traits, with a brief justification for each, in your contribution to the discussion thread for "Activity Prompt #2 - Character and Banksy."

Some things to think about:

1. What gender is Banksy? What proof do you have that Banksy is male or female or something else? What assumptions are you making about Banksy's gender based on what you have learned about Banksy? 
2. How do Banksy's character traits fit into a larger category? What category is that and how does knowing the category help us imagine Banksy's traits and what they might mean? By categories, I mean does Banksy belong to the category of an artist? street punk? savvy entrepreneur? Is Banksy married? emotional? ironic? thoughtful? 
3. Ask yourself, how do I imagine Banksy walking down the street? Why do I imagine it that way? 
3. How does nationality affect how we see Banksy as a character? What's Banksy's race? Does this matter to how we imagine Banksy? 
4. There are some images, texts, and sounds available online that are supposedly Banksy the person. How do these representations fit a stereotype or match--or resist--our expectations for Banksy's gender, mannerisms, political stance, etc.? 
5. What's in a name? What does the name "Banksy" mean? What are the connotations? How does the name "Banksy" shape how we imagine Banksy the person?

**Notes:**

As always, be as specific as possible with your answers--name actual character traits--gait, teeth, skin-type, hair, body parts, mannerisms, gestures, fashion, jewelry; be precise about details. 

Try to connect what you're discovering about how you imagine Banksy to assumptions you might be making about the characters in *Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore.* For example, what does the name "Kat Potente" mean? What category does Kat belong to, and how does that category affect how we understand or imagine her? (Remember, gender is a category.) What does the name "Clay Jannon" mean? What category does Clay belong to, and how does it affect how we imagine or understand him? Do these characters belong to a particular genre of literature? How so?
