**Outcomes Statement:** This activity prompt is designed to get you thinking about how *The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage* challenges us to think about how we read images and words together.

**Task:**

Pick any advertisement you like, as long as it appears in paper (or as a sign / billboard--no commercials or web ads). consider how the words work with the image by addressing some of the approaches below:

- How do the words reflect the image (how do they interact with each other)?
- How do the words resist the image (does the image "say" something different than the words)?
- What position are the words in relative to the image (where is the image; where are the words)?
- What "style" is the image? Is it drawn, a photograph, an abstraction?
- What "style" is the writing? Big letters, small letters, san serif, easy to read, hard to decipher?
- What comments can you make about the general design of the image and the words? Are the words horizontal when the picture is vertical? What is the orientation of the ad--portrait or landscape?

Once you've done some of this preliminary work, make a claim about how the images and words work together the emphasize a theme. Or, you might explore how the interplay between the words and the image leads to interesting, but conflicting, meanings. In short, explore how image and word work together to reflect the characteristics of theme.
