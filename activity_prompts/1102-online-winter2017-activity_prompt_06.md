**Outcomes Statement:** This activity prompt is designed to get you thinking about how *Ready Player One* emphasizes games and gameplay in order to help us visualize situations and question the nature of reality.

**Task:**

Think about--and actually design--a playable board game that corresponds to *Ready Player One*. 

Some things to think about:

1. What parts of the novel does your board game emphasize and why?   
2. How does a board game--or any game--leverage the interpretative skills for things such as character, setting, and symbol? 
3. How does your board game use icons, or symbols, to represent things? 
4. How does your board game recreate the act of reading and interpretation in its playing? In other words, how does the game recreate the act of reading the novel?
5. How does your board game represent the "reality" of the *OASIS*, assuming it even represents the *OASIS* (no reason that it must!).

**Notes:**

Designing a board game can be an interesting way of gaining insights about our reading. How we visualize--or represent--the narrative, plot-line, characters in the novel can tell us a lot about how we are "reading" them. Understanding how we "read" novels--how we actually visualize the content--tells us a lot about how we perceive reality. It might suggest that, despite our best efforts otherwise, we view reality myopically--from only our own perspective. 

At the same time, thinking about the rules the govern the gameplay of your board game can reveal assumptions about the act of reading itself. In other words, how do the rules for games *make* us play it in a particular way? As your instructor, I am in effect making you read the novels and poetry in this course according to a theme (the hacker or technology). That move influences how you read the novels in the same way that *Scrabble* influences how many words you can make by only allowing you seven letters at a time. 

When you respond to this activity prompt, tell us about the thought process behind some of your decisions, don't focus only on the rules / look of the game--but we're interested in that too!!

Feel free to upload a picture of the game if you actually make it--and you should!!
