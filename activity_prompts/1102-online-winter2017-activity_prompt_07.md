**Outcomes Statement:** This activity prompt is designed to get you thinking about how *Ready Player One* emphasizes intertextual references to the 1980s, particularly pop cultural references.

**Task:**

After choosing a single chapter in the novel, make a list of all the references that signal the 1980s. Note that there are some chapters that have many references to the 1980s and some that have very few. Choose your chapter based on the amount of work you want to put into the activity. 

Once you have your list, do a quick online search and see if you can find a tangible example of each reference. You're not looking for Wikipedia-type explanations here; you're looking for things such as YouTube videos of the actual television show or song or a picture of the actual item. 

Now that you have built an archive of all the references, think about what's missing or what was abundant and make a suggestion about what they might mean. For instance, if a reference was mentioned in the book but there was no tangible example, what does that mean for our ability to grasp the metaphor it might represent? Or, if it is abundant, what might that suggest about how the book is exploiting popularity to make the book's metaphors more clear. 

This Activity Prompt is about seeing how intertextual references make meaning in a text. The text represents a specific kind of reality because of how it discriminates those references--we're interested both in what's there, but also in what's not there. In others words, if you find yourself thinking about what the book leaves out, you're raising some interesting questions about the nature of representation in cultural production.
