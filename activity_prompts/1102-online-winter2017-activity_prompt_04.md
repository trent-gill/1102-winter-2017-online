**English 1102 (Online) Activity Prompt #4 - Week 4  
Complete by Feb. 1st  
Winter 2017 - Douglas College - David N. Wright**

**Outcomes Statement:** This activity prompt is designed to get you thinking about how *JPod* uses literature to comment on how consumption is infused into our understanding of the world.

**Task:**

Sometime before February 1st, pick an advertisement for a restaurant you think is particularly compelling--make sure it's the advertisement that is compelling, not the restaurant. Examine what it is in the advertisement that makes the restaurant look appealing (or not). 

Some things to think about:

1. What assumptions do you make about what the restaurant serves? 
2. How do your expectations (what you want to eat) influence the kind of advertisement you are drawn to? 
3. What larger category does the restaurant fit into and how do the objects (images *and* text) in the advertisement signal that category? 
4. What details does the advertisement leave out? (It's easy to see what's in the image or the text of the advertisement, but what doesn't the advertisement speak about or represent? Does it show a picture of two people bug-eyed at the bill? Or seated next to the bathroom?)
5. How does the advertisement appeal to you? Is it a character speaking? Who is it? A setting (picture of the restaurant)? Where in the restaurant? Is it a mood? How is that set? A metaphor? What's being contrasted / compared? What precisely is the advertisement selling (hint: it's rarely the restaurant itself but the particulars of "an experience." We need to think about the details (objects) that signal what kind of experience it is).
6. How does Douglas Coupland's novel invite us to consume it? How does the novel speak to food? How does the novel represent advertisements, consumerism, consumption more generally?

**Notes:**

This activity is trying to get you to examine the details of an advertisement in order to make some sense of the visual cues in *JPod*. *JPod* is a difficult text for most readers, because it is a mix of visual metaphors (the outside of a ramen noodle package) and a self-referential narrative (the text begins by referencing the author). However, it is important to remember that like *Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore*, *JPod* is representing a reality to us. It has themes, points of emphasis, human-like characters, settings. There's nothing in the text we do not experience or that we cannot imagine. That said, Douglas Coupland's text is doing something quite different than *Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore*. So, one of the things we're trying to do now is key in on a theme--consumption in this case--is represented in the text. In the next module on *JPod*, we'll do the same thing but with setting (Vancouver!).  

The above activity is trying to demystify the act of interpretation. If we stick with trying to understand *what* we are experiencing in *JPod* rather than the *why* we are experiencing it, the text has some interesting things to say about the nature of consumption, authorship, consumerism, and popular culture (all themes!). We don't have to read texts looking for reasons why they were written, or authorial motivations. Most of the time, we need to read them to see how they represent the experience of living--whether we have lived that way of not. Again, it's all about what you visualize and how you visualize--or imagine--the text in your head. Try to think about how that image in your head comes to be and what it might mean. If you're confused, what is it that's making you confused in the text? When are you not confused? Then, examine the differences to get at what the text is trying to represent (it might be confusion!). If you took all the scenes in *JPod* where food was mentioned, or characters were eating, what could you say about how the text "makes meaning" and comments on the nature of consumerism?
