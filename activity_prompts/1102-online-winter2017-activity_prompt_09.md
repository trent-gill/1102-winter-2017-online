**Outcomes Statement:** This activity prompt is designed to get you thinking about how *Ready Player One* proposes several different realities around games and gaming.

**Task:**

Play any of the games below (as often as you like!):

- [Galaga](http://www.tripletsandus.com/80s/80s_games/html5_galaga.htm)
- [Atari Games](https://www.atari.com/arcade#!/arcade/atari-promo)
- [Joust](http://tripletsandus.com/80s/80s_games/joust_shockwave2.htm)
- [Adventure](http://my.ign.com/atari/adventure)

Once you have steeped yourself in the experience of retro video games, think about how *Ready Player One* represents these games. In the discussion thread, comment on the experience of playing the games versus your experience reading about them in *Ready Player One*. Did you know about the games in *Ready Player One* before you read about them? Did the experience of playing them yourself match the experience of playing them that Wade describes--did *Joust* live up to the billing? What was your perception of the games based on the fiction compared to your perception of the game when you played it online?

The discussion being encouraged here is one around the perception of reality. How do we perceive realities when we read them in a novel? How are characters manipulating realities and making them conform to the expectations of the narrative they are building? How must settings and symbols be manipulated in the game world in order to match real world expectations? 

Games and gaming is a big theme in *Ready Player One*, how does playing games yourself give you insight into the text and its symbology? In other words, what role did your cultural capital play in how you decoded (Hall!) the text?
