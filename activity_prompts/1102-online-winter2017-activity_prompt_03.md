**English 1102 (Online) Activity Prompt #3 - Week 3  
Complete by Jan. 27th   
Winter 2017 - Douglas College - David N. Wright**  

---

**Outcomes Statement:** This activity prompt is designed to get you thinking about symbol and how symbol shapes how we understand story events, character motivations (hidden or apparent), and our cultural assumptions about what objects represent (or "mean something"). 

**Task:**

Sometime before January 27th, pick out your favourite [typeface / font](https://www.fastcodesign.com/3028971/whats-the-difference-between-a-font-and-a-typeface). You can search the internet for a typeface or, using word processing software such as Word or Pages, pick one that's already on your computer. 

Once you have chosen your typeface, think about and discuss why you chose that typeface. What does it represent to you? What are the specific characteristics of the typeface that drew you to choose it? Be specific and point to the particulars of the typeface and how those particulars mean something. 

Some things to think about:

1. What assumptions do you make about your reader's enjoyment of the typeface? What role does the reader play in guiding your choice? 
2. How does the typeface you chose fit into a larger category of typefaces (sans serif, script, web ready)? How does the category shape the typeface and how it looks to you or to readers? 
3. What's in a name? How is the name of the typeface important? How is the name symbolic of the typeface? 
4. Think about the objects named and handled (the theatrical among you might want to think of the word "props") by characters in *Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore*. How are these objects representative of character traits? Like you did with the typeface you chose, try to explain and point to the specific connections between object (typeface) and character (you / reader).

**Notes:**

This activity is trying to get you to examine the details of something in order to figure out what the object might represent. For example, if we want to suggest that Clay is a symbol in *Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore*, then we need to explain how, precisely, he is symbolic by relating it to examples in the text. We need to connect his character to something symbolic, or some symbolic outcome, in the novel. 

Let's take as an example Clay's name. It might be symbolic as a quite literal representation of his stasis in the novel--he doesn't seem to be going anywhere, stuck in a routine, unable to "flow." At the same time, he is malleable, able to take on numerous roles, a bit of a changeling, sometimes shaped heavily by others. There's lots of examples in the text that would illustrate those symbolic characteristics. If we point to examples of his actions in the text, then we can start to see how his name is symbolic of how we are supposed to "read"--or understand--his character, and the traits that go along with "making meaning" in that character.   

If we dig a little deeper though, and we say Clay's name out loud, we hear "cl√©"--the French word for "key." Given that Clay is the "key" to solving the riddle of the novel, his name is symbolic on another level as well. Point is, we need to think about all the details of a character's name--auditory and literal in the two examples here--to decipher the particulars of his symbolic role in the novel. Culturally, we might say that Clay is symbolic of "hipsters" or "Millennials." Doing so, however, relies on our cultural knowledge and assumptions about the characteristics--or the specifics inside the general categories--of those groups. Yet another way to understand how the text "makes meaning" through symbols.

Thinking about typefaces is a good way to practice getting at the above. Imagine the typeface you chose as a symbol, or character, that represents **things**. What are those things it represents, what do they mean, and where does that meaning come from? Once we decipher all that, we can better understand how the typeface itself, before one even writes or reads a word, "makes meaning." All of which is good practice for figuring out what parts of *Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore* go into giving the book meaning.
