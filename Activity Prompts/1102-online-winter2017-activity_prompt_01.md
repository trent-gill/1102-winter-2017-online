**English 1102 (Online) Activity Prompt #1 - Week 1  
Complete by Jan. 11th 
Winter 2017 - Douglas College - David N. Wright**  

---

**Preamble**

This is the first in what will usually be a weekly "activity prompt" that I include in the course module to get the discussion thread going. These activity prompts are for everyone in the course to complete and discuss on the discussion thread for the week's course module. You will need to be able to discuss what you learned from completing the activity prompt, especially how it influenced your reading of the texts we'll be covering in the course. Suffice to say, most will find it extremely helpful to approach these activity prompts with a degree of formality:  

1. Write down your responses to the activity prompt's questions
2. When completing the activity prompt, always relate your thinking to the text(s) we're covering--don't just "do it," think about how the activity is enhancing--or detracting--from your experience of reading, interpretation, or understanding literary effect (character traits, symbols, metaphors, atmosphere, etc.).
3. If you cannot physically complete the prompt, imagine what it would be like to do it and come up with responses based on how you imagine the experience of completing the activity prompt. 

As I note in the course outline and expectations, I will set up a weekly discussion thread in Blackboard to facilitate discussion around the activity prompt. I'll check in on the discussion thread once or twice a week and discuss the activity prompts with those who are in the thread. Alternatively, you can discuss the activity prompts amongst yourselves--or take the conversation in another direction of more interest to you--by setting up your own discussion thread (check the Blackboard tutorials if you want help doing this).

**Task:**

Sometime before January 11th, visit a real, physical, brick and mortar, bookstore, any bookstore **other than** the Douglas College bookstore. Maybe there's a bookstore in the area where you live, or in a mall near you, or somewhere you're visiting--go there. Make a special trip if you have to--visit a bookstore you've heard about but never been to, or one you find using google maps. When you are visiting, pay attention to your surroundings and answer the following questions:

1. What's in a bookstore? Books obviously, but what else? What kinds of books? What are the topics? Are they big books, small books, giant books, kid's books? What's in a bookstore that isn't a book? How are the items in a bookstore related to each other? How does the store organize its items?  
2. What kind of a building is the bookstore in? What does the building look like? How do the surroundings both inside and outside the bookstore suggest "bookstore"?
3. What's the name of the bookstore? How does the name reflect--or not--what's inside the bookstore? 
4. Who's working at the bookstore? What do they look like? What are they wearing? How might they look the part of working in a bookstore?   
5. Which of your senses are triggered in the bookstore (smell, touch, taste, etc.)? How are your senses triggered--what specific items bring them on? What do your senses tell you about where you are?

**Notes:**

Be as specific as possible with your answers--name actual things, be precise about details. Think carefully about what the bookstore is trying to achieve: How is it selling you books? How is it staging the "experience" of reading? How is it organizing your interaction with the items inside it? How much do you need to know about a bookstore to navigate a bookstore? What exactly do you need to know about a bookstore to navigate a bookstore or find a book?
