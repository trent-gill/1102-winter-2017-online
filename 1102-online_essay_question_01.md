This essay assignment emphasizes close reading, without much (if any) need to read beyond the novel at hand. Please choose only one option. 

1) **Narrative**: What is significant about the text’s narrative? 

Write an academic essay in ~1000 words (MLA format) about how the narrative of either *Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore* or *JPod* is constructed and why its construction is compelling or unique. As you write, consider describing the general characteristics of the text (e.g., plot, genre, characterization, setting, and style) but also interpreting one or two key passages in detail. 

Here are some questions to help you get started: 

* What is the form of the text? How are pieces of the story stitched together? 
* How is time structured? Is it chronological? Non-linear? 
* How does the text flash back or flash forward? 
* How is it focalized? Who presents the story? What do they remember, know, ignore, or forget? How do they travel from place to place or moment to moment? 
* Are there interjections? If so, then how does the interjection communicate?  
* While reading, what must we assume or suspend? 
* Does the narrative have a beginning, middle, and end? If so, then where are they? If not, then why? 
* Is there resolution on the last page? To what effects on interpretation? 

If you choose this option, then feel free to write about the overall form of the text as well as a specific instance or two where its narrative structure influences how the story unfolds. Since you're writing an academic argument, you should probably include a claim/thesis supported by evidence, which is interpreted from multiple perspectives.

2) **Character**: What is significant about a character, other than the main character(s), operates in the text? 

Write an academic essay in ~1000 words (MLA format) about how a character, other than the main character(s), operates within an assigned text and why this approach to interpreting a character is compelling or unique. As you write, consider describing the general traits of the character (e.g., looks, actions, dress, mannerisms, associations, and style) but also interpreting one or two key passages in detail. 

Here are some questions to help you get started: 

* Does the character have agency or mobility in the text? In what situations? In relations with whom? 
* How does the character reflect or represent traits common to the everyday world? Is s/he anxious, happy, depressed, deadpan? How do these traits operate in the text--what do they do for us? 
* What do characters assume about each other? 
* What perspectives and positions are treated as the default or norm? 
* Who gets to speak, to whom, and when?
* Who is considered an expert, and under what assumptions? 
* How do characters switch codes or morph their behaviours across situations? How do they identify, and when? 
* Who is the text’s intended audience, and how does the text speak to them? To what effects on interpretation? 

If you choose this option, then feel free to write about character dynamics in the text and then anchor them in a specific instance or two where the text's accounts of character influence what we understand or assume about the text. Since you're writing an academic argument, you should probably include a claim/thesis supported by evidence, which is interpreted from multiple perspectives.

3) **Language**: What is significant about the use of language(s) in the text? 

Write an academic essay in ~1000 words (MLA format) about the use of language(s) in an assigned text and why this use is compelling or unique. As you write, consider describing the general characteristics of the text (e.g., plot, genre, characterization, setting, and style) but also interpreting one or two key passages in detail. 

Here are some questions to help you get started: 

* How would you describe the language of the text? 
* Which metaphors and phrases are repeated throughout the text?  
* How do characters speak to each other? To themselves? How many languages do they use? How do they translate or switch across languages?
* If there’s a narrator, then how would you describe their voice? 
* Which languages does the text combine or juxtapose? 
* When does the language convey information? When is it ambiguous? 
* Does the text create its own language? Its own words? If so, then why? 
* What is the social, cultural, or political function of language in the text?
* How does the text sound when you read it aloud? 
* Does the language correspond with your everyday life? What must you translate or look up? To what effects on interpretation? 

If you choose this option, then feel free to write about the overall use of language(s) in the text and then anchor it in a specific instance or two where language influences how communication unfolds. Since you're writing an academic argument, you should probably include a claim/thesis supported by evidence, which is interpreted from multiple perspectives.
