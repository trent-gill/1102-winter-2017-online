		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This is an example page. It's different from a blog post because it will stay in one place and will show up in your site navigation (in most themes). Most people start with an About page that introduces them to potential site visitors. It might say something like this:

<blockquote>Hi there! I'm a bike messenger by day, aspiring actor by night, and this is my website. I live in Los Angeles, have a great dog named Jack, and I like pi&#241;a coladas. (And gettin' caught in the rain.)</blockquote>

...or something like this:

<blockquote>The XYZ Doohickey Company was founded in 1971, and has been providing quality doohickeys to the public ever since. Located in Gotham City, XYZ employs over 2,000 people and does all kinds of awesome things for the Gotham community.</blockquote>

As a new WordPress user, you should go to <a href="http://digitalcultureslab.ca/douglascollege-online1102/winter2017/wp-admin/">your dashboard</a> to delete this page and create new pages for your content. Have fun!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>English 1102.090: Reading Literature and Culture (Online)  
Digital Culture - Winter 2017 - Douglas College 
David N. Wright / <a href="mailto:wrightd@douglascollege.ca">wrightd@douglascollege.ca</a>
Course Conduct and Expectations</strong> </p>

<hr />

<p><strong>General Guidelines: Discussion Threads and Online Course Sequencing</strong></p>

<p>A fully online course is a funny beast. We lose a lot of face-to-face interaction that we might get if we were in a room together. We need to recreate that interaction as best we can and provide space for everyone to chime in with what they think about the texts and themes under discussion in the course. </p>

<p>To this end, much of the course&#8217;s interaction will be conducted through discussion threads. Organized around the fifteen weeks of the semester, these threads will represent our discussion of the text or theme due for the week. Generally, I will lead the thread by asking a question, or giving you a task&#8211;&#8220;prompting&#8221; you to do something and talk back. As we build up steam moving through the course, the threads will be a valuable space to track your learning, ask questions, and generally take stock of what the course is, or has been, about. </p>

<p>To help orient ourselves in the online space, it&#8217;s helpful to impose a rubric&#8211;or set of expectations&#8211;to help us keep track of when we should be contributing and what stage the class discussion is at for that week. Here&#8217;s a rubric for this course: </p>

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="text-align:left;"/>
<col style="text-align:left;"/>
<col style="text-align:left;"/>
<col style="text-align:left;"/>
</colgroup>

<thead>
<tr>
	<th style="text-align:left;">Day of the Week</th>
	<th style="text-align:left;">What happens?</th>
	<th style="text-align:left;">Where are we at? What stage is the discussion?</th>
	<th style="text-align:left;">How should students be involved? (My expectations for your involvement)</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
	<td style="text-align:left;">Monday, anytime before 5pm</td>
	<td style="text-align:left;">DNW posts a prompt on the comment thread for that week, usually indicated by the name of the text or the theme we&#8217;re interested in for that week.</td>
	<td style="text-align:left;">Early stages, feeling our way, making basic connections.</td>
	<td style="text-align:left;">Ask questions about comprehension, basic concepts, check your learning.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>

<tbody>
<tr>
	<td style="text-align:left;">Monday 5:01pm - Wednesday 5:00pm</td>
	<td style="text-align:left;">Discussion continues amongst those in the class. People dive in, dive out, at different times ask questions, make comments, reflect.</td>
	<td style="text-align:left;">Getting more complicated, making connections, using literary terminology; we&#8217;ve left basic stuff behind, conversation is richer, more precise.</td>
	<td style="text-align:left;">Fewer responses, but more robust ones. Give time for people to come in and make comments.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>

<tbody>
<tr>
	<td style="text-align:left;">Wednesday 5:01pm - Friday 5:00pm</td>
	<td style="text-align:left;">The Reader Responses are up so conversation in the comment threads shifts to those responses, but some threads are still active, depending on what people need or want to talk about.</td>
	<td style="text-align:left;">We&#8217;re making connections between the Reader Responses and the earlier threads, thinking more robustly, winding down and checking our learning.</td>
	<td style="text-align:left;">You&#8217;re making sure to ask questions if there are things unresolved before we turn to the next subject, thinking about what we&#8217;ve been discussing in the course, responding to your classmates.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>

<tbody>
<tr>
	<td style="text-align:left;">Friday 5:01pm - Monday 5:00pm</td>
	<td style="text-align:left;">Less activity as we wait for the next module to start, but people might still want to reflect on the upcoming reading, issues they&#8217;re having, or thoughts that occurred out of sequence.</td>
	<td style="text-align:left;">Late stages, merging together with upcoming texts / themes; anticipating discussion to come.</td>
	<td style="text-align:left;">Chime in as you wish, discuss complexities, connections, upcoming reading, problems you might be having with the text.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<hr />

<p>In every instance, I will monitor the conversation threads and will be present in them. Generally, I will be present in threads on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, at some point during the day. I will usually announce my presence through a Blackboard announcement. You shouldn&#8217;t expect me in there all the time, nor do I expect you in there all the time. In an online course, conversations evolve and emerge sometimes quickly and sometimes over long periods of time. Make sure you read the threads before you chime in so that you do not repeat on-going or resolved conversations. Taking that into account, you can post to a thread or complete most other aspects of this course at your leisure. If 3am works for you, then fine; but don&#8217;t expect everyone else in the course to be present at that time&#8211;give others the space to work at their own leisure. </p>

<p><strong>Important:</strong> </p>

<p>Generally, the comment threads are designed to encourage discussion. You need to be able to discuss your thinking and the outcomes you arrived at&#8211;even if those outcomes are total failure. The point of the comment thread is to create a space where we can discuss your learning as it evolves. It is not a space to present perfected thoughts&#8211;leave that for essays and exams. It should go without saying, but you need to have done the reading. <strong>All of it.</strong> Carefully. Before you go into the comment threads. You should arrive in the thread ready to play. Nothing is more annoying than people asking about plot events or content, who have clearly not read the book and are looking to the threads for a shortcut. If you are not prepared, I reserve the right to block you from the thread until you are prepared because you cannot possibly contribute without having done any preparatory work.</p>

<p><strong>Discussion Thread Participation:</strong></p>

<p>Since conversations are essential to the quality of this class, we will work together to create an atmosphere premised on difference. College-level discourse does not shy away from sensitive issues, including questions of race, gender, class, sexuality, politics, and religion, and neither will we. There are going to be differences in opinions, beliefs, and interpretations when we read literature, question it, and engage history and culture. You need not agree with the arguments presented in discussion threads or with what your peers or I have to say. In fact, it is important to think critically and question course material. But please do so intelligently, without the assumption that everyone agrees with you or shares your experiences. Difference is central to creating a discussion in which a variety of ideas can be exchanged and points of view can be explored. Ultimately, what is crucial to this course is that you are comfortable expressing yourself and your ideas. If, for whatever reason, you are not, then you should notify me immediately. I understand that some people are more comfortable discussing ideas, concepts, or what they have learned, than others. That said, participation augments learning. If you are not comfortable in discussion threads, as written statements that reflect your level of knowledge and comprehension, you will have difficulty getting anything out of this course. You cannot &#8220;troll&#8221; discussion threads, contributing nothing, and expect to be successful in the course learning objectives. As with many other things, you will get out of discussion what you put into it. </p>

<p><strong>Expectations for Discussion Threads:</strong></p>

<p>I expect that you will be spending anywhere from 6&#8211;8 hours each week working on the materials for the course, either through reading, the discussion threads, the Reader Responses, or essay drafting (or all four). If you are doing less than that, you’re not meeting the expectations for the class and can expect the results that come with lack of effort and engagement. </p>

<p>How much time should you spend in the discussion threads? That&#8217;s up to you. You&#8217;ll have no doubt noticed by now that the comment threads are not a graded aspect of this course. Suffice to say, you should spend at minimum two hours a week, especially if you do not have a Reader Response due, discussing the course in discussion threads. In general, the time you spend contributing to the discussion threads is the same as time you would be physically present in the classroom. </p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Discussion Climate:</strong></p>

<p>Douglas College is committed to promoting, providing, and protecting a positive, supportive, and safe working and learning environment for all its members. Students and faculty members are expected to adhere to the <a href="https://www.douglascollege.ca/~/media/4310D1BD02AE4A74B9D0832D61FA18A1.ashx">User Conduct Policy</a>. Students should alert me immediately if they have any questions about this policy and its application, or if they have concerns about course proceedings or participants. I reserve the right to exclude individuals from discussions if their conduct does not reflect the above. </p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Trigger Warning:</strong></p>

<p>In this course, we will encounter descriptive scenes that some might find unsettling&#8211;drug abuse, murder, poverty, child abuse. If at any point you feel uncomfortable being present while the material is being discussed, please feel free to remove yourself from that discussion, either before that discussion happens or, if you are caught unaware, in real time.
No explanation is needed. However, if the analysis of the course texts will be difficult enough to prevent your success in the course, please contact me by Email; discussions between you and I through Email remain private. Plot synopses of all the texts we will encounter are readily available on Wikipedia, feel free to consult the synopsis beforehand and decide if the content of this course is the right fit for you.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Digital Culture - Winter 2017 - Douglas College
How to Do Well in this Course
David N. Wright</strong>

<hr />

<p>General Definitions:</p>

<p>Course Module - refers to the materials we will cover over the course of a week, usually. Sometimes, a module will correspond to a specific theme&#8211;a week where we discuss the representation of Race in <em>Ready Player One</em>, for example. Sometimes, a course module will focus on a single text, sometimes more than one text. Sometimes, a course module will explore literary terminology, close reading strategies, or essay writing. Point is, a course module is simply a way of organizing the course materials into a focused topic that we can discuss for a given period of time. </p>

<p>Blackboard or Blackboard LMS or LMS - LMS stands for Learning Management System. We&#8217;ll do most of the course work inside the LMS. But, Blackboard has limitations, so I often post lectures and other materials to the class website. The class website is hosted outside in the real world and can be found here: <a href="http://digitalcultureslab.ca/douglascollege-online1102/winter2017/">http://digitalcultureslab.ca/douglascollege-online1102/winter2017/</a>. You should be comfortable checking both these spaces on your own, but I will always link to both in the Blackboard LMS. Make sure you understand that there&#8217;s a difference between Blackboard and the class website. The easiest distinction to remember is that Blackboard is interactive, the class website is not. </p>

<p>Email - When we&#8217;re not in discussion threads, writing blog posts, or making comments, Email is the main mode of communication between you and I. I will hold online office hours in Blackboard through the chat function, but if you have a quick question or need to hand in an essay, Email is the way to go. Please maintain a level of formality when you Email me and include the following: </p>

<p>Course Outline / Syllabus - This document represents a binding contract between you and I. If there&#8217;s ever any questions about what I expect or what the course requirements are, this is where you should look for the answers. Always read the course outline / syllabus <em>before</em> you Email me questions about expectations, due dates, assignment requirements. </p>

<hr />

<p>Here are a few tips for doing well in this course: </p>

<ul>
<li>Stay engaged. Get in the habit of checking into the online spaces for the course on a regular basis&#8211;set a schedule and stick to it. Try to come up with a question or comment about a text or concept we&#8217;ve discussed at least once a week, and post it to a discussion thread. Because it lives in the online ether, this course is easy to forget about. Keeping up and engaging on a regular basis is essential.</li>
<li>Give yourself time to deal with the technology. The internet breaks, Blackboard goes down, it&#8217;s hard to figure out new online spaces. Be patient, follow the help tutorials and give yourself plenty of time&#8211;particularly at the beginning&#8211;to counteract the annoyances of Blackboard and taking an online course.</li>
<li>Read the books before we discuss them. Otherwise, you will not be able to follow lectures or discussions. Plus, demonstrating you’ve read the book means you’ll likely do well on the final exam.</li>
<li>Write while you read. For me this means annotating a text as I read it. You can annotate print and digital texts. (Ask me if you need ideas or resources.)</li>
<li>Come to discussions with ideas and questions. Be curious. Seek connections not only between texts but also between this course and other courses you’re taking.</li>
<li>Take notes when you read. A good portion of the exams will cover what we discuss in comment threads or what&#8217;s included in the online lectures. Students who take good notes not only understand but also retain the material better. They also do better on the exams than students who do not take notes.</li>
<li>Let me know when you don’t follow what I’m saying (or doing). I find this stuff fascinating, but I will not always know what you want to investigate or learn more about. If you have questions, then please don&#8217;t hesitate to ask them. There&#8217;s no need to feel like an imposter in this course.</li>
<li>Persuasive writing takes time. Before you submit an essay, consider writing and circulating drafts. Ask friends or peers to give your writing a gander. Consider how your writing can extend and even complicate our discussions. Also, avoid writing that is primarily descriptive. Push your work into an analysis of the assumptions, aesthetics, and ambiguity at work in literature.</li>
<li>Be concrete when you comment on anyone&#8217;s work (including the texts we&#8217;re discussing). Quote it. Speak to specific gestures. And then respond with your own interpretations. When the work is by a peer, affirm their ideas (e.g., “I like how you…”).</li>
<li>Use discussion threads to share ideas, but also discuss what we’re reading outside of class (stuff we don&#8217;t <em>need</em> to discuss as part of the class module. If you have a question, then ask me or your classmates. If you hear something you want to remember, then write it down for later reference. If you feel like we’re ignoring something important in our discussion, then bring it to our attention. Consider forming reading and writing groups for the course.</li>
</ul>

Digital Culture - Winter 2017 - Douglas College

Reader Response Blog Posts and Commenting

<hr />

<p><strong>Due Dates:</strong> </p>

<p>The two Reading Responses are due at different times in the semester&#8211;one in the first half of the semester and one in the second half of the semester. Each Response, or post, is graded out of ten (10). The due dates are determined by your group assignment; these due dates are not flexible, and late submissions are not allowed. Make sure you know what group you are in, and what the due dates are for that group. <strong>Email me immediately if there&#8217;s an issue.</strong> </p>

<p>Reading Responses must be posted no later than 5pm on Wednesdays. We will begin posting on <strong>January 18th</strong>. Prompts for the Reader Responses will be available to the group with that week&#8217;s deadline no later than the Monday before the Wednesday you&#8217;re due to post. Comments&#8211;from everyone in the class&#8211;are due not later than the Friday after the Wednesday posting, at 5pm. Take note of the time deadlines and schedule yourself accordingly. </p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the schedule broken down: </p>

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="text-align:left;"/>
<col style="text-align:left;"/>
</colgroup>

<thead>
<tr>
	<th style="text-align:left;">Day of the Week (and Time)</th>
	<th style="text-align:left;">What will happen / What is due</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
	<td style="text-align:left;">Monday</td>
	<td style="text-align:left;">Prompt will arrive for the week&#8217;s Reader Response Post (only applies to those who have a post due). Check your group page or your Blackboard Email.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td style="text-align:left;">Wednesday, 5pm</td>
	<td style="text-align:left;">Reader Response Post is due. Responses must be posted to the relevant Blackboard blog and be available to the class by 5pm. Draft postings do not count.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td style="text-align:left;">Friday, midnight</td>
	<td style="text-align:left;">Comments are due on at least one Reader Response Post by a classmate. If you have not logged a comment by this time, you cannot receive credit for that week.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p><strong>Warning: Remember, there are no extensions or late posts / comments allowed. You miss the deadlines for posting and/or commenting, you get zero.</strong> </p>

<hr />

<p>Below is the Winter 2017 due date schedule that includes groups:</p>

<p>Group 1 (Google) - <strong>Jan. 18</strong> (<em>Mr. Penumbra</em>) / <strong>March 1</strong> (<em>Ready Player One</em>)<br/>
Group 2 (Microsoft) - <strong>Jan. 25</strong> (<em>Mr. Penumbra</em>) / <strong>March 8</strong> (<em>Ready Player One</em>)<br/>
Group 3 (Facebook) - <strong>Feb. 1</strong> (<em>JPod</em>) / <strong>March 15</strong> (<em>Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage</em>)<br/>
Group 4 (Apple) - <strong>Feb. 8</strong> (<em>JPod</em>) / <strong>March 22</strong> (<em>Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage</em>)<br/>
Group 5 (Intel) - <strong>Feb. 15</strong> (<em>Agrippa</em> and Poems) / <strong>March 29</strong> (<em>Popular Culture</em>) </p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Explanations:</strong> Each week there will be 5&#8211;7 students in a group who will each individually complete a Reader Response Blog Post to lead the class discussion and direction for the upcoming class module. Each Reader Response Post should be <strong>a minimum 500 word response</strong> to the prompt I deliver (see schedule above). Ideally, we&#8217;ll end up with 5&#8211;7 unique approaches to the text under discussion that respond to the prompt and lead to interesting comments from classmates. </p>

<p>Groups can respond together by taking a group approach to the prompt, but each individual must respond with a minimum 500-word response. There are no &#8220;team responses&#8221; or group posts allowed. I encourage you to discuss approaches, definitions, and parameters with members of your group, but you must post a Reader Response of your own that meets the minimum requirements to receive credit. </p>

<p><strong>General Expectations for Reader Response Blog Posts and Commenting:</strong> Expectations for completing Reader Response Blog Posts and commenting upon them are the same as they would be for essays minus the formatting requirements. Suffice to say, all the writing, comprehension, and critical thinking skills required for essays and exams will be needed to be successful in the Reader Response Blog Posts and commenting upon them. In particular, you should use literary terminology and an informed tone avoiding excessive informality. You should imagine the audience for the post to be someone you admire and whose opinion you respect. </p>

<p><strong>General Approach for Reader Response Blog Posts:</strong></p>

<p>Lead discussion of the texts and/or concepts of a week&#8217;s module by responding to the prompt delivered by me and outlining a context for our discussion&#8211;some interesting facet or application or connection or interpretation of the assigned text(s) and/or related text. You will post your Reader Response as noted above to the course blog in Blackboard that corresponds to the text under discussion. You will also monitor the comments connected to your post from your classmates, responding to the comments as warranted. </p>

<p><strong>General Expectations:</strong></p>

<p>Reader Response Blog Posts are not an opportunity for you to figure out what <em>I</em> might want to discuss or what <em>I</em> want to hear from you or to decipher <em>my</em> opinion on the topic or text at hand. Instead, think of the Reader Responses as an opportunity for <em>you</em> to shape how <em>we</em> approach a topic or text. The Reader Response Blog Posts are <em>your</em> chance to make the class relevant to <em>your</em> interests and to guide <em>your</em> learning in a way that suits <em>your</em> needs and interests. The Reader Response Blog Posts are <strong>not</strong> about writing for an instructor&#8211;they&#8217;re about giving you the chance to participate fully in how you experience learning in this course, or the particular course module. Recording your frustrations is also part of the process in completing Reader Response Blog Posts. You should feel free to record your frustrations, successes, highlights, and lowlights. Everything is valid as long as it is thoughtful. You should absolutely avoid writing as if you are reaching for a grade. You are trying to be thoughtful and learn something, not &#8220;write for a C.&#8221;</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Commenting on Reader Response Blog Posts (10% of your final grade):</strong></p>

<p><strong>General Task for Commenting:</strong> Each week, write a <strong>minimum 150 word comment</strong> on <strong>one</strong> Reader Response of interest to you. You should feel free to write more than one comment or write a comment on more than one post, but I will count <em>only</em> the first comment and that first comment must meet the minimum word requirement. After that, you are free to comment as often, or as little, and to whatever length you wish. You should read <strong>all</strong> the Reader Response Blog Posts and comment most fully on the one you think most interesting. Avoid commenting on the first one you see; <strong>your classmates are graded, in part, on the discussion their post generates.</strong> </p>

<p><strong>General Expectations for Commenting:</strong> Your comment should reflect some engagement with what the Reader Response Blog Post addresses. You might want to qualify something you noted in the Response, ask for clarification, or offer your own example affirming the Reader Response position. You should avoid &#8220;assessing&#8221; the Reader Response. While it is important to reinforce the effort of others, try not to spend most of your comment speaking to how &#8220;good&#8221; the post is&#8211;engage with the subject matter. Think of your comment as a contribution for ongoing discussion and debate. If your comment generates further discussion, you should follow up and continue that dialogue where warranted. </p>

<hr />

<p><strong>General Grading Rubric for Reader Response Blog Posts:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><em>10/10</em>: The content and delivery exceed expectations of the prompt, and exceed the 500 word minimum. The post demonstrates a highly proficient, even memorable knowledge of the course material, and includes other media, creative interpretations, and tertiary materials. The post sparks significant discussion.</li>
<li><em>9&#8211;8/10</em>: The content and delivery exceed expectations of the prompt, including the 500 word minimum. The post demonstrates a proficient knowledge and application of the course material, and includes other media and other relevant materials. The post sparks significant discussion.</li>
<li><em>6&#8211;7/10</em>: The content and delivery meet expectations of the prompt, including the 500 word minimum. The post demonstrates accepted knowledge of the course material, but little in the way of application. The post complies with the minimum expectations for the prompt. The post sparks some discussion.</li>
<li><em>5&#8211;6/10</em>: The content and delivery meet some expectations of the prompt, but did not meet the 500 word minimum or do not demonstrate knowledge or development of the course content. The post demonstrates accepted knowledge of the course material but sparks little to no discussion. As well, there may be significant language issues.</li>
<li><em>0&#8211;4/10</em>: The content and delivery do not meet any expectations of the prompt. The post does not demonstrate knowledge of the course material, and does not spark discussion. As well, there may be significant language issues. The post was late or incomplete&#8211;did not meet minimum word count.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Grading for Commenting On Reader Response Blog Posts:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>If the single comment meets the 150-word minimum and is contributed before the Friday 5pm deadline, you get one mark. If there&#8217;s no comment by Friday at 5pm, you get no mark.</li>
</ul>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>English 1102.090: Reading Literature and Culture (Online)  
Digital Culture - Winter 2017 - Douglas College 
David N. Wright / <a href="mailto:wrightd@douglascollege.ca">wrightd@douglascollege.ca</a>
Course Conduct and Expectations</strong> </p>

<hr />

<p><strong>General Guidelines: Discussion Threads and Online Course Sequencing</strong></p>

<p>A fully online course is a funny beast. We lose a lot of face-to-face interaction that we might get if we were in a room together. We need to recreate that interaction as best we can and provide space for everyone to chime in with what they think about the texts and themes under discussion in the course. </p>

<p>To this end, much of the course&#8217;s interaction will be conducted through discussion threads. Organized around the fifteen weeks of the semester, these threads will represent our discussion of the text or theme due for the week. Generally, I will lead the thread by asking a question, or giving you a task&#8211;&#8220;prompting&#8221; you to do something and talk back. As we build up steam moving through the course, the threads will be a valuable space to track your learning, ask questions, and generally take stock of what the course is, or has been, about. </p>

<p>To help orient ourselves in the online space, it&#8217;s helpful to impose a rubric&#8211;or set of expectations&#8211;to help us keep track of when we should be contributing and what stage the class discussion is at for that week. Here&#8217;s a rubric for this course: </p>

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="text-align:left;"/>
<col style="text-align:left;"/>
<col style="text-align:left;"/>
<col style="text-align:left;"/>
</colgroup>

<thead>
<tr>
	<th style="text-align:left;">Day of the Week</th>
	<th style="text-align:left;">What happens?</th>
	<th style="text-align:left;">Where are we at? What stage is the discussion?</th>
	<th style="text-align:left;">How should students be involved? (My expectations for your involvement)</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
	<td style="text-align:left;">Monday, anytime before 5pm</td>
	<td style="text-align:left;">DNW posts a prompt on the comment thread for that week, usually indicated by the name of the text or the theme we&#8217;re interested in for that week.</td>
	<td style="text-align:left;">Early stages, feeling our way, making basic connections.</td>
	<td style="text-align:left;">Ask questions about comprehension, basic concepts, check your learning.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>

<tbody>
<tr>
	<td style="text-align:left;">Monday 5:01pm - Wednesday 5:00pm</td>
	<td style="text-align:left;">Discussion continues amongst those in the class. People dive in, dive out, at different times ask questions, make comments, reflect.</td>
	<td style="text-align:left;">Getting more complicated, making connections, using literary terminology; we&#8217;ve left basic stuff behind, conversation is richer, more precise.</td>
	<td style="text-align:left;">Fewer responses, but more robust ones. Give time for people to come in and make comments.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>

<tbody>
<tr>
	<td style="text-align:left;">Wednesday 5:01pm - Friday 5:00pm</td>
	<td style="text-align:left;">The Reader Responses are up so conversation in the comment threads shifts to those responses, but some threads are still active, depending on what people need or want to talk about.</td>
	<td style="text-align:left;">We&#8217;re making connections between the Reader Responses and the earlier threads, thinking more robustly, winding down and checking our learning.</td>
	<td style="text-align:left;">You&#8217;re making sure to ask questions if there are things unresolved before we turn to the next subject, thinking about what we&#8217;ve been discussing in the course, responding to your classmates.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>

<tbody>
<tr>
	<td style="text-align:left;">Friday 5:01pm - Monday 5:00pm</td>
	<td style="text-align:left;">Less activity as we wait for the next module to start, but people might still want to reflect on the upcoming reading, issues they&#8217;re having, or thoughts that occurred out of sequence.</td>
	<td style="text-align:left;">Late stages, merging together with upcoming texts / themes; anticipating discussion to come.</td>
	<td style="text-align:left;">Chime in as you wish, discuss complexities, connections, upcoming reading, problems you might be having with the text.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<hr />

<p>In every instance, I will monitor the conversation threads and will be present in them. Generally, I will be present in threads on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, at some point during the day. I will usually announce my presence through a Blackboard announcement. You shouldn&#8217;t expect me in there all the time, nor do I expect you in there all the time. In an online course, conversations evolve and emerge sometimes quickly and sometimes over long periods of time. Make sure you read the threads before you chime in so that you do not repeat on-going or resolved conversations. Taking that into account, you can post to a thread or complete most other aspects of this course at your leisure. If 3am works for you, then fine; but don&#8217;t expect everyone else in the course to be present at that time&#8211;give others the space to work at their own leisure. </p>

<p><strong>Important:</strong> </p>

<p>Generally, the comment threads are designed to encourage discussion. You need to be able to discuss your thinking and the outcomes you arrived at&#8211;even if those outcomes are total failure. The point of the comment thread is to create a space where we can discuss your learning as it evolves. It is not a space to present perfected thoughts&#8211;leave that for essays and exams. It should go without saying, but you need to have done the reading. <strong>All of it.</strong> Carefully. Before you go into the comment threads. You should arrive in the thread ready to play. Nothing is more annoying than people asking about plot events or content, who have clearly not read the book and are looking to the threads for a shortcut. If you are not prepared, I reserve the right to block you from the thread until you are prepared because you cannot possibly contribute without having done any preparatory work.</p>

<p><strong>Discussion Thread Participation:</strong></p>

<p>Since conversations are essential to the quality of this class, we will work together to create an atmosphere premised on difference. College-level discourse does not shy away from sensitive issues, including questions of race, gender, class, sexuality, politics, and religion, and neither will we. There are going to be differences in opinions, beliefs, and interpretations when we read literature, question it, and engage history and culture. You need not agree with the arguments presented in discussion threads or with what your peers or I have to say. In fact, it is important to think critically and question course material. But please do so intelligently, without the assumption that everyone agrees with you or shares your experiences. Difference is central to creating a discussion in which a variety of ideas can be exchanged and points of view can be explored. Ultimately, what is crucial to this course is that you are comfortable expressing yourself and your ideas. If, for whatever reason, you are not, then you should notify me immediately. I understand that some people are more comfortable discussing ideas, concepts, or what they have learned, than others. That said, participation augments learning. If you are not comfortable in discussion threads, as written statements that reflect your level of knowledge and comprehension, you will have difficulty getting anything out of this course. You cannot &#8220;troll&#8221; discussion threads, contributing nothing, and expect to be successful in the course learning objectives. As with many other things, you will get out of discussion what you put into it. </p>

<p><strong>Expectations for Discussion Threads:</strong></p>

<p>I expect that you will be spending anywhere from 6&#8211;8 hours each week working on the materials for the course, either through reading, the discussion threads, the Reader Responses, or essay drafting (or all four). If you are doing less than that, you’re not meeting the expectations for the class and can expect the results that come with lack of effort and engagement. </p>

<p>How much time should you spend in the discussion threads? That&#8217;s up to you. You&#8217;ll have no doubt noticed by now that the comment threads are not a graded aspect of this course. Suffice to say, you should spend at minimum two hours a week, especially if you do not have a Reader Response due, discussing the course in discussion threads. In general, the time you spend contributing to the discussion threads is the same as time you would be physically present in the classroom. </p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Discussion Climate:</strong></p>

<p>Douglas College is committed to promoting, providing, and protecting a positive, supportive, and safe working and learning environment for all its members. Students and faculty members are expected to adhere to the <a href="https://www.douglascollege.ca/~/media/4310D1BD02AE4A74B9D0832D61FA18A1.ashx">User Conduct Policy</a>. Students should alert me immediately if they have any questions about this policy and its application, or if they have concerns about course proceedings or participants. I reserve the right to exclude individuals from discussions if their conduct does not reflect the above. </p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Trigger Warning:</strong></p>

<p>In this course, we will encounter descriptive scenes that some might find unsettling&#8211;drug abuse, murder, poverty, child abuse. If at any point you feel uncomfortable being present while the material is being discussed, please feel free to remove yourself from that discussion, either before that discussion happens or, if you are caught unaware, in real time.
No explanation is needed. However, if the analysis of the course texts will be difficult enough to prevent your success in the course, please contact me by Email; discussions between you and I through Email remain private. Plot synopses of all the texts we will encounter are readily available on Wikipedia, feel free to consult the synopsis beforehand and decide if the content of this course is the right fit for you.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Winter 2017<br/>
Dr. David N. Wright / <a href="mailto:wrightd@douglascollege.ca">wrightd@douglascollege.ca</a>
Online Office Hours (Chat): Tues. 11am - 12pm</strong> </p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong></p>

<p>Please note that this section of English 1102 is a fully online class. This means that there are no face-to-face meetings, but students are expected to log into the course a minimum of 2 times each week and should plan to spend at least 3.5 hours online each week in course activities (excluding reading the assigned novels and preparing assignments). Students must have access to a computer and, usually, a high-speed internet connection to be able to take this class, as well as be proficient with word processing, attaching documents, and other computer applications. Please take note of the unique features and requirements of this course. It is your responsibility to keep up-to-date with what’s happening in the class and to do all the required reading and other work.</p>

<p>If you are not a self-motivated student, you may want to consider whether an online course is the right choice for you. This type of course can sometimes be difficult for those who aren’t prepared to take on the responsibility for learning the course material on their own time and scheduling the required time to complete the work. You will be expected to do a good deal of learning on your own. I will guide you, but often you will be required to find your own way and report your findings without the benefit of my council.</p>

<p>We will be using the Blackboard Version 9 course management platform (LMS) for the course. Emails will usually be sent within the course using the course internal messages function and will not usually be sent to your external email address. This means you will need to check into the course regularly each week (daily is recommended) to check on whether you have any emails from your instructor or classmates. Emails will not usually be sent to external email addresses.</p>

<p><strong>Course Description:</strong></p>

<p>In this course, we will examine artistic (primarily literary) representations of digital culture. We&#8217;ll look at texts that represent coders, hackers, and computers, analyzing how those texts reflect or interpret our digital world. In particular, we&#8217;ll look at how digital culture reflects traditional literary themes such as gender, race, labour, anxiety, and gaming, among many others. The course will offer an opportunity to see how artistic production represents the structures of our digital lives. As we work to understand representations of digital culture, we&#8217;ll pay attention to how digital culture reflects social attitudes, cultural practices, and political movements. The aim is to understand how the devices of literary interpretation&#8211;character, setting, theme, narrative&#8211;can help us dissect the underlying currents of an emerging digital environment. </p>

<p><strong>A note about the class readings:</strong> This course makes extensive use of secondary information freely available on the Internet. Links to required readings and other materials will be linked through Blackboard. Please make every effort to do the readings. <strong>You must purchase the texts above</strong>; these novels require a hard copy&#8211;paper, digital or otherwise. You can purchase all the books for this course at the Douglas College Bookstore or, using the ISBN numbers above, through another source, such as Amazon. You do not need the specific editions above, any edition will do, but the page numbers I mention may not be the same&#8211;that&#8217;s your responsibility. If you order a book for the course from an online retailer, please be aware that delivery timelines may not mesh with the course timelines. Make sure you have the book in time to complete the reading before we begin discussing the text in class. It&#8217;s best to buy all the books at the beginning of the course, but consult the course schedule for specific dates. </p>

<p>You may be asked to access other materials, ie. film adaptations, either at the College library or, for those students attending remotely, through resources local to you. You will be given plenty of notice should you need to access these materials.</p>

Please include your name in the filename (e.g., essay1_davidnwright.docx). I will acknowledge the receipt of your essay by Email within 24 hours. If you submit your essay via an Email address other than the one assigned by Douglas College upon your enrolment, please be advised that you may be subject to the terms and conditions of the United States Patriot Act.</li>
<li>You are responsible for reading ALL the readings listed in the course schedule and available through the class website.</li>
<li>All exams and other tests, assignments, or comment threads, are due on the assigned date. There are no make up exams, tests, assignments, or comment threads. You must keep up with the required due dates and complete the course as required by course communications, the course calendar, and this course outline. If you miss an exam, other required tests, assignments, or comment threads, you will receive a grade of 0/100 for that element.</li>
<li>Late essays will be accepted for 7 days after the due date as determined by Email date stamp. <strong>No late essays will receive any written comments</strong>. Extensions beyond 7 days or extended absences should be accounted for in person and will require proper substantiating documentation (i.e.: a doctor&#8217;s note) or may receive a penalty of 5% per day, including weekends, beginning from the <strong>original due date</strong>.</li>
<li>Essays and other class assignments cannot be rewritten. <strong>Proper <a href="https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/747/01/" target="_blank">MLA citation formatting</a> is required for all essays</strong> and essays must be formatted according to MLA citation style. Correct citation, according to the rules of the MLA style guide, is mandatory for all essays. Failure to cite correctly will result in a marked essay with no marginal notes.</li>
<li>Though not explicitly stated above, <strong>draft writing is a required element for this course</strong>. Please be sure to make yourself aware of editing session dates and any penalties associated with missing them.</li>
<li>Students who do not submit both essays and complete both exams (70% of the course work) will receive a final grade of UN (unofficial withdrawal) for the course, which will later become an F.</li>
<li>Plagiarism&#8211;using the ideas or words of another&#8211;a published source, website, chat-room, forum thread, internet portal, social networking site, tutor, or friend&#8211;in your writing without proper acknowledgement&#8211;is a serious offence that will result in your work being forwarded to the Associate Dean, LLPA for assessment and may result in a note being placed in the student’s file, which could be grounds for expulsion. Plagiarism penalties apply to <strong>any assessed component of this course</strong> and I will show no pity toward examples of plagiarism. Ignorance is not an excuse. By taking this course, you agree that all submitted assignments may be subject to an originality review.</li>
<li>All Douglas College policies apply in this course; in particular, I draw your attention to the <a href="https://www.douglascollege.ca/~/media/27C599ABC76048A0A713648565906273.ashx" target="_blank">Academic Integrity Policy</a> and the <a href="https://www.douglascollege.ca/~/media/4310D1BD02AE4A74B9D0832D61FA18A1.ashx" target="_blank">User Conduct policy</a>.</li>
</ol>

<hr />

<p><strong>Explanations:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Essays:</strong> The course will require two formal essays. In order to pass&#8211;a grade of P&#8211;the course, students must submit both essays. Topics for the essays will be distributed well in advance of the due date. Essays should be typed, double-spaced, in a legible 12pt font, with minimum 1 inch margins and be formatted as noted in the course policies above&#8211;in MLA style with a title, proper in-text citation and a work(s) cited page. They should be submitted via Email and include your name in the file name as noted in the policies above. </p>

<p>For those of you unfamiliar with the requirements of an English course, please remember that good writing is imperative for a positive assessment. Essays should include a relevant thesis statement supported by exposition that is clear and logical. Errors in sentence structure, argumentative logic and grammar, spelling, etc., will affect your grade negatively. Take the time to proof-read your work for typos, formal problems and logic. Keep an extra copy of all essays (except those written in exam booklets). It is your responsibility to provide a copy of your essay&#8211;or other work&#8211;should it go missing. </p>

<hr />

<p><strong>General Grading Rubric for Essays:</strong></p>

<p><em>A+</em>: The content exceeds expectations of the prompt. It is incredibly focused and coherently integrates examples with explanations or analysis. It demonstrates awareness of its own limitations or implications, and it considers multiple perspectives when appropriate. It reflects in-depth engagement with the selected text, and the argument is incredibly persuasive.</p>

<p><em>A- through A</em>: The content exceeds expectations of the prompt. It is focused and coherently integrates examples with explanations or analysis. It demonstrates awareness of its own limitations or implications, and it considers multiple perspectives when appropriate. It reflects in-depth engagement with the selected text, and the argument is persuasive.</p>

<p><em>B- through B+</em>: The content meets expectations of the prompt. It is focused and coherently integrates examples with explanations or analysis. It demonstrates some awareness of its own limitations or implications, and it considers multiple perspectives when appropriate. It reflects engagement with the selected text, and the argument is sound.</p>

<p><em>C through C+</em>: The content meets some expectations of the prompt. It is somewhat focused and integrates some examples with explanations or analysis. It demonstrates minimal awareness of its own limitations or implications, and it considers few perspectives. It reflects engagement with the selected text; however, the argument is not as sound as it could be.</p>

<p><em>C- through P</em>: The content does not meet expectations of the prompt. It is not focused, or it does not integrate examples with explanations or analysis. It does not demonstrate awareness of its own limitations or implications, or it does not consider multiple perspectives. It does not reflect engagement with the selected text, and the argument is not sound.</p>

<p><em>F</em>: Serious errors in basic language use. Incomprehensible. The content is missing or falls extremely short of the word count or does not address any aspect of the prompt&#8217;s expected outcomes.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Exams (30% of your final mark &#8211; 15% each):</strong></p>

<p><strong>Exams:</strong> Exams will require a good knowledge of the texts assigned in the course and the literary terminology that might be applied to a reading of them. Questions will be a mix of short answer and essay questions that ask the student to demonstrate an acquired and applied knowledge of the texts and concepts covered in the course. In every instance, the emphasis is on the student’s ability to explain clearly and accurately, with a degree of originality, the major concepts of the course.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Online Course Discussion Requirements</strong></p>

<p>This course requires participation in online discussion threads. These discussions are the online equivalent of class attendance. While your participation in these online discussion threads is not assessed, it is essential for the successful completion of the course. Please refer to the below and the Course Conduct and Expectations for further details about what is expected for online participation. </p>

<p><strong>Discussion Thread Participation:</strong></p>

<p>Since conversations are essential to the quality of this class, we will work together to create an atmosphere premised on difference. College-level discourse does not shy away from sensitive issues, including questions of race, gender, class, sexuality, politics, and religion, and neither will we. There are going to be differences in opinions, beliefs, and interpretations when we read literature, question it, and engage history and culture. You need not agree with the arguments presented in discussion threads or with what your peers or I have to say. In fact, it is important to think critically and question course material. But please do so intelligently, without the assumption that everyone agrees with you or shares your experiences. Difference is central to creating a discussion in which a variety of ideas can be exchanged and points of view can be explored. Ultimately, what is crucial to this course is that you are comfortable expressing yourself and your ideas. If, for whatever reason, you are not, then you should notify me immediately. I understand that some people are more comfortable discussing ideas, concepts, or what they have learned, than others. That said, participation augments learning. If you are not comfortable in discussion threads, as written statements that reflect your level of knowledge and comprehension, you will have difficulty getting anything out of this course. You cannot &#8220;troll&#8221; discussion threads, contributing nothing, and expect to be successful in the course learning objectives. As with many other things, you will get out of discussion what you put into it. </p>

<p><strong>Expectations for Discussion Threads:</strong></p>

<p>I expect that you will be spending anywhere from 6&#8211;8 hours each week working on the materials for the course, either through reading, the discussion threads, the Reader Responses, or essay drafting (or all four). If you are doing less than that, you’re not meeting the expectations for the class and can expect the results that come with lack of effort and engagement. </p>

<p>How much time should you spend in the discussion threads? That&#8217;s up to you. You&#8217;ll have no doubt noticed by now that the comment threads are not a graded aspect of this course. Suffice to say, you should spend at minimum two hours a week, especially if you do not have a Reader Response due, discussing the course in discussion threads. In general, the time you spend contributing to the discussion threads is the same as time you would be physically present in the classroom. </p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Discussion Climate:</strong></p>

<p>Douglas College is committed to promoting, providing, and protecting a positive, supportive, and safe working and learning environment for all its members. Students and faculty members are expected to adhere to the <a href="https://www.douglascollege.ca/~/media/4310D1BD02AE4A74B9D0832D61FA18A1.ashx">User Conduct Policy</a>. Students should alert me immediately if they have any questions about this policy and its application, or if they have concerns about course proceedings or participants. I reserve the right to exclude individuals from discussions if their conduct does not reflect the above. </p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Trigger Warning:</strong></p>

<p>In this course, we will encounter descriptive scenes that some might find unsettling&#8211;drug abuse, murder, poverty, child abuse. If at any point you feel uncomfortable being present while the material is being discussed, please feel free to remove yourself from that discussion, either before that discussion happens or, if you are caught unaware, in real time.
No explanation is needed. However, if the analysis of the course texts will be difficult enough to prevent your success in the course, please contact me by Email; discussions between you and I through Email remain private. Plot synopses of all the texts we will encounter are readily available on Wikipedia, feel free to consult the synopsis beforehand and decide if the content of this course is the right fit for you.</p>

<p><strong>Ethics Statement:</strong> </p>

<p>This course prioritizes the formal requirements of “academic writing” usually understood as proper citation, the logical development of persuasive claims, and a somewhat formal voice. You have an ethical responsibility to write at a level that reflects the absolute best of your abilities in the English language. Remember, your completed essay is a reflection of your effort. Your essays will be graded for the application of course content in the service of making a claim, grammar, vocabulary, argumentation, rhetorical style, organization, and for their attention to the rules of proper academic essay format. All of these components figure equally into your final grade.</p>

<p><strong>Academic Honesty:</strong> </p>

<p>As a student, your primary job is to demonstrate academic integrity in everything you do: the way you conduct yourself in class, the way you present your ideas in assignments, and the way you demonstrate competency during exams. Academic integrity embodies everything from treating your classmates and me with respect to coming to class prepared to citing all of your sources in your written work. Acts of academic dishonesty include, but are not limited to, plagiarism (using the ideas of another without giving credit), handing in an essay already submitted for credit in a previous class, cheating on a test or exam, allowing another person (even an editor or a tutor) to rewrite segments of your assignments, or knowingly handing in work that is not your own. I take academic dishonesty very seriously; it represents not only a failure to meet course requirements, but an act of intellectual theft and a contravention of the social contract of the college. I will fully pursue all cases of academic dishonesty, without exception. Familiarize yourself with the college’s policies on this and other relevant academic matters: <a href="http://www.douglascollege.ca/programs-courses/general-information/grading">http://www.douglascollege.ca/programs-courses/general-information/grading</a></p>

<p><strong>Peer Evaluators / Tutors:</strong> </p>

<p>While having others respond to your work outside of class can be helpful, if someone else does more than point out errors and problems and discuss corrections in a general way (if a friend, family member, or an individual solicited on-line rewrites your sentences, adds words that are not your own, or provides you with a thesis or structure for your essay) you are not learning to improve your work. Having others write all or part of your essay or assignments is plagiarism and academic dishonesty. If you are working with a tutor on your essays, you should inform me of that fact and be prepared to submit, if requested, all notes and drafts of your home essays so that I can see what kind of help you have received. Failure to do so will result in an F/0% on the assignment in question. </p>

<p>You are encouraged to use the Douglas College online tutoring service, especially if you are not able to see a tutor in person. Check the Learning Centre website for more information: <a href="http://www.douglas.bc.ca/services/learning-centre.html">http://www.douglas.bc.ca/services/learning-centre.html</a></p>

<p><strong>Statement of Responsibilities:</strong> </p>

<p>My responsibilities for this course are to introduce a wide range of examples and explanations that will illuminate the texts and guide your interpretation of them. I will also offer guidance on academic writing styles, and offer strategies for generating, organizing, and writing essays. If there is ever something you do not understand, please do not hesitate to raise questions. As well, feel free to Email me if you want clarifications, suggestions, or general guidance. However, be prepared with something to talk about, or some general ideas about your problem(s). I will not develop, write, proofread, etc., your paper for you. I encourage you to take advantage of my Email with questions should you have any problems, but I will not teach the course directly to individuals who do not participate fully in the online spaces for the course. </p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Explanation of Grading Procedures:</strong> </p>

<p>If you receive a grade you are unhappy with, or do not understand, you should make every effort to address it promptly. Do not let grades fester or take on undue gravity. I am more than willing to explain where you went wrong and give you plenty of pointers for improvement. If you do not attend to issues with your writing, you cannot expect to improve. I am never grading your work with an eye for cruelty. I am grading your work in order to show you where you stand amongst students who take&#8211;or have taken&#8211;an English literature course at Douglas College. As much as possible, try to manage your expectations where grades are concerned. The point of the course is to improve your writing. If your writing did not need improvement, or assessment in a college context, you would not be here. This course is difficult because it demands a level of writing that reflects college and university contexts, not the aptitude of your personal expression or comprehension. In this course, I am grading your writing and how you present the content of your essay. </p>

<p><strong>E-Mail:</strong></p>

<p>With the exception of holidays and weekends, I will respond to your emails within twenty-four hours. Please maintain a sense of formality in your Emails to me. I have many students in many different courses. Please tell me what course you are in and what your name is when you Email me. </p>

<p><strong>Learning Climate:</strong></p>

<p>Douglas College is committed to promoting, providing, and protecting a positive, supportive, and safe working and learning environment for all its members. Students and faculty members are expected to adhere to the <a href="https://www.douglascollege.ca/~/media/4310D1BD02AE4A74B9D0832D61FA18A1.ashx">User Conduct Policy</a>. Students should alert me immediately if they have any questions about this policy and its application, or if they have concerns about course proceedings or participants.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Course Learning Outcomes:</strong> </p>

<p>Upon completion of any first-year English literature course, the successful student should be able to:</p>

<ul>
<li>read receptively and reflectively, with sensitivity to the subtleties of language;</li>
<li>recognize and understand literary devices;</li>
<li>practice writing as a process involving pre-writing, drafting, revising and editing;</li>
<li>write an essay of literary criticism that develops an interpretive thesis supported by appropriate and correctly cited evidence; and</li>

</ul>

<p>Upon completion of English 1102, the successful student should also be able to</p>

<ul>
<li>recognize and understand the elements of theme in literature;</li>
<li>understand and analyze the relationship of theme to other literary elements, such as plot, character, setting, figurative language and irony; and</li>
<li>recognize and appreciate connections between the theme(s) studied in the course and social issues.</li>
<li>recognize the characteristics of figurative language (such as imagery, metaphor and symbolism)</li>
</ul>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>English 1102.090 (Online) - Reading Themes in Literature (Digital Culture)
Winter 2017 - Douglas College - David N. Wright
Essay Assignment #1 - Close Reading
~750 - 1000 Words (3 - 4 pages)
Due: Feb. 15, 2017, by Email<br/>
Weight: 20% </p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Task:</strong> After choosing <strong>one</strong> of the three questions below, write an essay that interprets a particular facet of <strong>either</strong> <em>Mr. Penumbra&#8217;s 24-Hour Bookstore</em> <strong>or</strong> <em>JPod</em> and makes a claim in support of something you think is significant about what the text represents.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Notes:</strong> This writing assignment emphasizes close reading, without need to read beyond the novel. You should focus your interpretation on how a specific element of the text diverges from <a href="http://digitalcultureslab.ca/douglascollege-online1102/winter2017/lecture-module-3/ target="_blank"">&#8220;normative&#8221;</a> meanings. Avoid trying to address the <em>entire</em> text, or multiple characters, and do not spend a great deal of time recounting plot events. You should show your audience how an interpretation of specific <strong>things</strong> in the text works and what&#8217;s significant about those <strong>things</strong> when we try to understand how the text makes meaning. You should not present a book review or plot synopsis that serves only to demonstrate you have read the book. Focus on how one of the contexts below is represented in a <strong>single</strong> character, symbol, metaphor, or event in the text, and which can be evidenced through a specific passage or two in the text. Then, speak to how that representation&#8211;as illustrated by your interpretation of the passage from the text&#8211;diverges from&#8211;or affirms&#8211;our expectations, assumptions, or biases. Finally, suggest how your interpretation&#8211;as evidenced by the passage from the text&#8211;is significant for our reading of the novel. </p>

<p>Remember that what I expect from you is that you have something to say about how the novel makes meaning. Do not write for any expectation other than that you have a willing reader who wants to read your interpretation of the text at hand. Please do not write for what you think I expect. Write what <em>you</em> think. Taking the above instructions into account, I want to read about your perspective, not the perspective you think I want from you. <strong>Your audience is NOT me. Your audience is a group of people who have read the text and who are curious about what you think is significant about it.</strong> </p>

<p>While format, style, word count, and other formal elements of the essay count toward your assessment in this assignment, the majority of your grade comes from the soundness and presentation of your content. Pay attention to how the essay demonstrates good sentence structure, word choice, paragraphing, logic, coherence, clarity, cohesion, and thoughtfulness. An essay that is perfect formally, but demonstrates poor sentence structure, incoherent word choice, poor paragraph structure, poor logic, lack of clarity, rushed and unresolved claims will be graded far, far lower than an essay that is sub-par formally but reflects solid sentence structure, clear syntax, word choices, paragraphing, and logic, precise focus, coupled with thoughtful, resolved, and assertive claims speaking to what&#8217;s signifiant about the text. Obviously, formatting is important, but for example, a terrible essay that meets the word count will not pass; an excellent essay that does not meet the word count will pass. </p>

<hr />

<p>1) What is significant about the text’s narrative? </p>

<p>How is the narrative of one of the texts constructed and why is its construction compelling or unique. As you write, consider describing the general characteristics of the text (e.g., plot, genre, characterization, setting, and style) but also interpreting one or two key passages in detail. </p>

<p>Below are some questions to help you get started. These are <em>potential</em> avenues for discussion. Please do not treat these questions as needing to be answered in your paper. You could write a paper that addresses or responds to none of these questions. At most, you should respond to one or maybe two of the questions below and remember that you must assert what&#8217;s significant for our reading in your answer to these questions. These questions are here to help you get started or think about what you have to do. They are not meant to be <a href="https://www.google.ca/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=prescriptive" target="_blank">prescriptive</a>. </p>

<ul>
<li>What is the form of the text? How are pieces of the story stitched together?</li>
<li>How is time structured? Is it chronological? Non-linear?</li>
<li>How does the text flash back or flash forward?</li>
<li>How does it use print style (typefaces, script), if at all?</li>
<li>How is it focalized? Who presents the story? What do they remember, know, ignore, or forget? How do they travel from place to place or moment to moment?</li>
<li>While reading, what must we assume or suspend?</li>
<li>Does the narrative have a beginning, middle, and end? If so, then where are they? If not, then why?</li>
<li>Is there resolution on the last page? Does it change our interpretation?</li>
</ul>

<p>If you choose this option, feel free to write about the overall form of the text and to also interpret a specific passage or two where the text&#8217;s narrative structure clearly influences how the story unfolds. Since you&#8217;re writing an academic argument, you should probably include a claim/thesis supported by evidence from the text. </p>

<hr />

<p>2) What is the geographic setting of the text, and why is that setting significant? </p>

<p>Describe one geographic setting in one of the texts and explain why that setting is significant. Of note, this geographic setting should be an actual place that exists or once existed on Earth. As you write, consider the details that matter for the geography of fiction: names of countries and states/provinces, demographics, capital cities, urban and rural locations, histories of place, climate, landscape. You should refer to passages in the text that describe the setting and the emphasis of this assignment should be on the significance of that setting and how it &#8220;makes meaning&#8221; in text. </p>

<p>Below are some questions to help you get started. These are <em>potential</em> avenues for discussion. Please do not treat these questions as needing to be answered in your paper. You could write a paper that addresses or responds to none of these questions. At most, you should respond to one or maybe two of the questions below and remember that you must assert what&#8217;s significant for our reading in your answer to these questions. These questions are here to help you get started or think about what you have to do. They are not meant to be <a href="https://www.google.ca/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=prescriptive" target="_blank">prescriptive</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Where does the text take place?</li>
<li>Where do characters say they are from? Where are they going? Where do they feel like they belong?</li>
<li>How does the text describe its settings? From whose perspective(s)?</li>
<li>What values does the text associate with land? With rural areas? With urban areas?</li>
<li>How does your familiarity with the setting influence how you visualize the text?</li>
<li>When you talk about settings in the text, how specific can you get? Country? City? Neighbourhood? Street? Building? Why does this specificity matter?</li>
</ul>

<p>If you choose this option, feel free to interpret one particular geographic setting in the text. When you address the significance of the geographic setting, you can focus on the particulars of that setting as they are outlined in a passage or two from your selected text. Since you&#8217;re writing an academic argument, you should probably include a claim/thesis supported by evidence from the text. </p>

<hr />

<p>3) What is significant about the language (words) in the text? </p>

<p>How is the language (words) in one of the texts compelling or unique. As you write, consider describing the general characteristics of the text (e.g., plot, genre, characterization, setting, and style) but also interpreting one or two key passages in detail. </p>

<p>Below are some questions to help you get started. These are <em>potential</em> avenues for discussion. Please do not treat these questions as needing to be answered in your paper. You could write a paper that addresses or responds to none of these questions. At most, you should respond to one or maybe two of the questions below and remember that you must assert what&#8217;s significant for our reading in your answer to these questions.

<ul>
<li>How would you describe the language of the text?</li>
<li>Which metaphors and phrases are repeated throughout the text?</li>
<li>How do characters speak to each other? To themselves? How many languages do they use? How do they translate or switch across languages?</li>
<li>How would you describe the voice of the narrator?</li>
<li>Which languages does the text combine or juxtapose?</li>
<li>When does the language convey information? When is it ambiguous?</li>
<li>Does the text create its own language? Its own words? If so, then why?</li>
<li>How does the text sound when you read it aloud?</li>
<li>How is language embodied in the text?</li>
<li>Does the language correspond with your everyday life? What must you translate or look up? How does this influence your interpretation?</li>
</ul>

<p>If you choose this option, feel free to write about the overall language in the text and interpret a specific passage or two where language (words) influences how communication unfolds in the text. Since you&#8217;re writing an academic argument, you should probably include a claim/thesis supported by evidence from the text.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong><p>English 1102.090 (Online) - Reading Themes in Literature (Digital Culture)
Winter 2017 - Douglas College - David N. Wright
Essay Assignment #2 - Close Reading Themes
1000 - 1250 Words (4 - 5 pages)</strong>
Due: April 12, 2017 - 11:59pm (Essay will be marked, returned with comments; no resubmission)
Due: April 18, 2017 - 11:59pm (Essay will be marked, returned by request, will not include comments)
<strong>Weight: 20%</strong></p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Preface:</strong> Note that there are two due dates for this essay. Those who hand in the essay on April 12th will have their essays marked and returned with my comments. Those who hand in the essay on April 18th will have their essays marked but returned only by request and will not receive written comments. There is no penalty, other than the absence of my comments, for handing in the essay on April 18th. Those who hand in the essay on April 12th <strong>cannot resubmit on April 18th</strong>.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>I cannot accept essays in person; you must submit by Email or Blackboard.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Essays received after the April 18th due date will not be accepted.</strong></li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p><strong>Task:</strong> After choosing <strong>one</strong> of the four questions below, write an essay that interprets a particular facet of <strong>either</strong> <em>Ready Player One</em> <strong>or</strong> <em>Agrippa</em> <strong>or</strong> <em>The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage</em> and makes a claim in support of something you think is significant about what the text represents (or how it &#8220;makes meaning&#8221;).</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Notes:</strong> This writing assignment emphasizes close reading, without need to read beyond the novel. You should focus your interpretation on how the text represents a theme. Avoid trying to address the <em>entire</em> text, or multiple characters, and do not spend a great deal of time recounting plot events. You should show your audience how an interpretation of specific <strong>things</strong> in the text works and what&#8217;s significant about those <strong>things</strong> when we try to understand how the text represents&#8211;or defines&#8211;a theme. You should not present a book review or plot synopsis that serves only to demonstrate you have read the book. Focus on how one of the contexts below is represented in a <strong>single</strong> character, symbol, metaphor, or event in the text, and which can be evidenced through specific references to the text. Then, speak to how that representation&#8211;as illustrated by your interpretation of the text&#8211;diverges from&#8211;or affirms&#8211;our expectations, assumptions, or biases about a theme. Finally, suggest how your interpretation&#8211;as evidenced by the text&#8211;is significant for our understanding of the text and what it represents&#8211;or defines&#8211;thematically. </p>

<p>Remember that what I expect from you is that you have something to say about how the text represents and defines themes. Do not write for any expectation other than that you have a willing reader who wants to engage with your interpretation of the text at hand. Please do not write for what you think I expect. Write what <em>you</em> think. Taking the above instructions into account, I want to read about your perspective, not the perspective you think I want from you. <strong>Your audience is NOT me. Your audience is a group of people who have read the text and who are curious about what you think is significant about its theme.</strong> </p>

<p>While format, style, word count, and other formal elements of the essay count toward your assessment in this assignment, the majority of your grade comes from the soundness and presentation of your content. Pay attention to how the essay demonstrates good sentence structure, word choice, paragraphing, logic, coherence, clarity, cohesion, and thoughtfulness. An essay that is perfect formally, but demonstrates poor sentence structure, incoherent word choice, poor paragraph structure, poor logic, lack of clarity, rushed and unresolved claims will be graded far, far lower than an essay that is sub-par formally but reflects solid sentence structure, clear syntax, word choices, paragraphing, and logic, precise focus, coupled with thoughtful, resolved, and assertive claims speaking to what&#8217;s signifiant about the text. Obviously, formatting is important, but, for example, a terrible essay that meets the word count will not pass; an excellent essay that does not meet the word count will pass. </p>

<p>No matter which question you answer, write about how the theme (identity, power, reality, history) operates in the text. In other words, how and why does the text represent that theme the way it does: what is its effect on how a reader might interpret a character, symbol, setting, or POV? Remember to nest your answer in specific references or examples from the text and include a claim/thesis that offers an interpretation of the prompts below. </p>

<p><strong>Special Note:</strong> Being a comic, <em>The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage</em> presents a somewhat special case for textual evidence. When referring to the comic, you should include the image to which you are referring in the text of your essay as you would a quote from a written text. The image should be cited consistently, so that I can find it, according to the MLA stylesheet. You should also make sure to offer an interpretation of <strong>both</strong> the words and the image(s). You cannot appropriately address the prompts below using <em>The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage</em> without referencing all the specifics inherent in the text. Avoid addressing only the images or only the text in <em>The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage</em> <strong>where both are present</strong>. When no words are present, or no image(s) present, in your textual example, it might offer an opportunity to discuss the implications of such absences in the text. </p>

<hr />

<p>1) <strong>Identity</strong>: What is significant about how identity operates in the text? </p>

<p>How does the theme of identity operate in the chosen text and why is this approach to identity (in the text) compelling or unique? As you write, consider briefly describing the general characteristics of the text (e.g., plot, genre, characterization, setting, and style) but focus on interpreting one or two key passages in detail to illustrate your claim. </p>

<p>Below are some questions to help you get started. These are <em>potential</em> avenues for discussion. Please do not treat these questions as needing to be answered in your paper. You could write a paper that addresses or responds to none of the questions below, only to the prompt. At most, you should respond to one or maybe two of the questions below and remember that you must assert what&#8217;s significant for our interpretation of the text in your answer to these questions. These questions are here to help you get started or think about what you have to do. They are not meant to be <a href="https://www.google.ca/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=prescriptive">prescriptive</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>How do individuals represent themselves in the text and why?</li>
<li>What role do assumptions about people play in the text and why are the assumptions significant?</li>
<li>How do topics such as race, cultural capital, gender, sexual orientation, sexism get reflected in identities? (If you answer this question, pick only one of the above topics to discuss&#8211;narrow the focus!)</li>
<li>What is normal in the text? Why are certain perspectives and positions treated as the default or norm?</li>
<li>How do the characters&#8217; voices represent identities and why is this significant?</li>
<li>How do characters switch codes or morph their behaviours across situations? How do they identify, and when?</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>2) <strong>Reality</strong>: What is significant about how reality is represented in the text? </p>

<p>How is reality represented in the chosen text and why is this approach to representing reality (in the text) compelling or unique? As you write, consider briefly describing the general characteristics of the text (e.g., plot, genre, characterization, setting, and style) but focus on interpreting one or two key passages in detail to illustrate your claim. Remember this question <strong>is not</strong> asking you about how &#8220;realistic&#8221; the text is, but how it chooses to represent different or parallel realities.</p>

<p>Below are some questions to help you get started. These are <em>potential</em> avenues for discussion. Please do not treat these questions as needing to be answered in your paper. You could write a paper that addresses or responds to none of the questions below, only to the prompt. At most, you should respond to one or maybe two of the questions below and remember that you must assert what&#8217;s significant for our interpretation of the text in your answer to these questions. These questions are here to help you get started or think about what you have to do. They are not meant to be <a href="https://www.google.ca/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=prescriptive">prescriptive</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>What are the characteristics of reality and why are those characteristics important to character, setting, story, or POV?</li>
<li>How do racism, patriarchy, colonialism, ableism, homophobia, xenophobia, transphobia, classism, weightism, and/or sexism influence the perception of reality for characters?</li>
<li>What assumptions does the text make about reality and why are they significant?</li>
<li>What is understood as &#8220;real&#8221; and &#8220;unreal&#8221; in the text? When and why is the distinction significant?</li>
<li>How and why do characters transcend realities?</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>3) <strong>Power</strong>: What is significant about how power operates in the text? </p>

<p>How does the theme of power operate in the chosen text and why is this approach to power (in the text) compelling or unique? As you write, consider briefly describing the general characteristics of the text (e.g., plot, genre, characterization, setting, and style) but focus on interpreting one or two key passages in detail to illustrate your claim. </p>

<ul>
<li>Who has agency or mobility in the text? In what situations? In relations with whom?</li>
<li>How do racism, patriarchy, colonialism, ableism, homophobia, xenophobia, transphobia, classism, weightism, and/or sexism operate in the text?</li>
<li>What do characters assume about each other?</li>
<li>What perspectives and positions are treated as the default or norm?</li>
<li>Who gets to speak, to whom, and when?</li>
<li>Who is considered an expert, and under what assumptions?</li>
<li>How do characters switch codes or morph their behaviours across situations? How do they identify, and when?</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>4) <strong>History</strong>: What is significant about how history, or a historical event, operates in the text? </p>

<p>How does history operate in the chosen text and why is this approach to history (in the text) compelling or unique? As you write, consider briefly describing the general characteristics of the text (e.g., plot, genre, characterization, setting, and style) but focus on interpreting one or two key passages in detail to illustrate your claim. </p>

<p>Below are some questions to help you get started. These are <em>potential</em> avenues for discussion. Please do not treat these questions as needing to be answered in your paper.

<ul>
<li>Consider how and why the text chooses to represent particular details&#8211;names, participants, dates, locations, descriptions, documentation, controversies, and memories. What&#8217;s significant about these details? How and why might they be biased? Who is making the decisions about what details to include?</li>
<li>What are the histories and events upon which your selected text relies?</li>
<li>To which documents or records do characters refer and why?</li>
<li>What events are remembered or mentioned often in the text?</li>
<li>How is the history coded? With what or whom is it associated?</li>
<li>Which events haunt the text or its characters?</li>
<li>Which events are represented, revised, or illustrated by the text?</li>
<li>When does the text read more like non-fiction than fiction? Which historical events are used as material for that non-fiction?</li>
<li>Which events do we assume actually happened? Which events appear fabricated? Why are such distinctions significant?</li>
<li>When do you trust the text&#8217;s account of history or reality? When don&#8217;t you? Why?</li>
<li>How do you draw boundaries between fiction and history? To what effects on interpretation?</li>
</ul>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Syllabus: ENGL 1102&#8211;090: Reading Literature and Culture<br/>
Digital Culture<br/>
Winter 2017<br/>
Dr. David N. Wright / <a href="mailto:wrightd@douglascollege.ca">wrightd@douglascollege.ca</a>
Online Office Hours (Chat): Tues. 11am - 12pm</strong> </p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong></p>

<p>Please note that this section of English 1102 is a fully online class. This means that there are no face-to-face meetings, but students are expected to log into the course a minimum of 2 times each week and should plan to spend at least 3.5 hours online each week in course activities (excluding reading the assigned novels and preparing assignments). Students must have access to a computer and, usually, a high-speed internet connection to be able to take this class, as well as be proficient with word processing, attaching documents, and other computer applications. Please take note of the unique features and requirements of this course. It is your responsibility to keep up-to-date with what’s happening in the class and to do all the required reading and other work.</p>

<p>If you are not a self-motivated student, you may want to consider whether an online course is the right choice for you. This type of course can sometimes be difficult for those who aren’t prepared to take on the responsibility for learning the course material on their own time and scheduling the required time to complete the work. You will be expected to do a good deal of learning on your own. I will guide you, but often you will be required to find your own way and report your findings without the benefit of my council.</p>

<p>We will be using the Blackboard Version 9 course management platform (LMS) for the course. Emails will usually be sent within the course using the course internal messages function and will not usually be sent to your external email address. This means you will need to check into the course regularly each week (daily is recommended) to check on whether you have any emails from your instructor or classmates. Emails will not usually be sent to external email addresses.</p>

<p><strong>Course Description:</strong></p>

<p>In this course, we will examine artistic (primarily literary) representations of digital culture. We&#8217;ll look at texts that represent coders, hackers, and computers, analyzing how those texts reflect or interpret our digital world. In particular, we&#8217;ll look at how digital culture reflects traditional literary themes such as gender, race, labour, anxiety, and gaming, among many others. The course will offer an opportunity to see how artistic production represents the structures of our digital lives. As we work to understand representations of digital culture, we&#8217;ll pay attention to how digital culture reflects social attitudes, cultural practices, and political movements. The aim is to understand how the devices of literary interpretation&#8211;character, setting, theme, narrative&#8211;can help us dissect the underlying currents of an emerging digital environment. </p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Required Texts:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Cline, Ernest. <em>Ready Player One: A Novel.</em> (ISBN: 978&#8211;0307887443)</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>A note about the class readings:</strong> This course makes extensive use of secondary information freely available on the Internet. Links to required readings and other materials will be linked through Blackboard. Please make every effort to do the readings. <strong>You must purchase the texts above</strong>; these novels require a hard copy&#8211;paper, digital or otherwise. You can purchase all the books for this course at the Douglas College Bookstore or, using the ISBN numbers above, through another source, such as Amazon. You do not need the specific editions above, any edition will do, but the page numbers I mention may not be the same&#8211;that&#8217;s your responsibility. If you order a book for the course from an online retailer, please be aware that delivery timelines may not mesh with the course timelines. Make sure you have the book in time to complete the reading before we begin discussing the text in class. It&#8217;s best to buy all the books at the beginning of the course, but consult the course schedule for specific dates. </p>

<p>You may be asked to access other materials, ie. film adaptations, either at the College library or, for those students attending remotely, through resources local to you. You will be given plenty of notice should you need to access these materials.</p>

Extensions beyond 7 days or extended absences should be accounted for in person and will require proper substantiating documentation (i.e.: a doctor&#8217;s note) or may receive a penalty of 5% per day, including weekends, beginning from the <strong>original due date</strong>.</li>
<li>Essays and other class assignments cannot be rewritten. <strong>Proper <a href="https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/747/01/" target="_blank">MLA citation formatting</a> is required for all essays</strong> and essays must be formatted according to MLA citation style. Correct citation, according to the rules of the MLA style guide, is mandatory for all essays. Failure to cite correctly will result in a marked essay with no marginal notes.</li>

</ol>

<hr />

<p><strong>Explanations:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Essays:</strong> The course will require two formal essays. In order to pass&#8211;a grade of P&#8211;the course, students must submit both essays. Topics for the essays will be distributed well in advance of the due date. Essays should be typed, double-spaced, in a legible 12pt font, with minimum 1 inch margins and be formatted as noted in the course policies above&#8211;in MLA style with a title, proper in-text citation and a work(s) cited page. They should be submitted via Email and include your name in the file name as noted in the policies above. </p>

<p>For those of you unfamiliar with the requirements of an English course, please remember that good writing is imperative for a positive assessment. Essays should include a relevant thesis statement supported by exposition that is clear and logical. Errors in sentence structure, argumentative logic and grammar, spelling, etc., will affect your grade negatively. Take the time to proof-read your work for typos, formal problems and logic. Keep an extra copy of all essays (except those written in exam booklets). It is your responsibility to provide a copy of your essay&#8211;or other work&#8211;should it go missing. </p>

<hr />

<p><strong>General Grading Rubric for Essays:</strong></p>

<p><em>A+</em>: The content exceeds expectations of the prompt. It is incredibly focused and coherently integrates examples with explanations or analysis. It demonstrates awareness of its own limitations or implications, and it considers multiple perspectives when appropriate. It reflects in-depth engagement with the selected text, and the argument is incredibly persuasive.</p>

<p><em>A- through A</em>: The content exceeds expectations of the prompt. It is focused and coherently integrates examples with explanations or analysis. It demonstrates awareness of its own limitations or implications, and it considers multiple perspectives when appropriate. It reflects in-depth engagement with the selected text, and the argument is persuasive.</p>

<p><em>B- through B+</em>: The content meets expectations of the prompt. It is focused and coherently integrates examples with explanations or analysis. It demonstrates some awareness of its own limitations or implications, and it considers multiple perspectives when appropriate. It reflects engagement with the selected text, and the argument is sound.</p>

<p><em>C through C+</em>: The content meets some expectations of the prompt. It is somewhat focused and integrates some examples with explanations or analysis. It demonstrates minimal awareness of its own limitations or implications, and it considers few perspectives. It reflects engagement with the selected text; however, the argument is not as sound as it could be.</p>

<p><em>C- through P</em>: The content does not meet expectations of the prompt. It is not focused, or it does not integrate examples with explanations or analysis. It does not demonstrate awareness of its own limitations or implications, or it does not consider multiple perspectives. It does not reflect engagement with the selected text, and the argument is not sound.</p>

<p><em>F</em>: Serious errors in basic language use. Incomprehensible. The content is missing or falls extremely short of the word count or does not address any aspect of the prompt&#8217;s expected outcomes.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Exams (30% of your final mark &#8211; 15% each):</strong></p>

<p><strong>Exams:</strong> Exams will require a good knowledge of the texts assigned in the course and the literary terminology that might be applied to a reading of them. Questions will be a mix of short answer and essay questions that ask the student to demonstrate an acquired and applied knowledge of the texts and concepts covered in the course. In every instance, the emphasis is on the student’s ability to explain clearly and accurately, with a degree of originality, the major concepts of the course.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Online Course Discussion Requirements</strong></p>

<p>This course requires participation in online discussion threads. These discussions are the online equivalent of class attendance. While your participation in these online discussion threads is not assessed, it is essential for the successful completion of the course. Please refer to the below and the Course Conduct and Expectations for further details about what is expected for online participation. </p>

<p><strong>Discussion Thread Participation:</strong></p>

<p>Since conversations are essential to the quality of this class, we will work together to create an atmosphere premised on difference. College-level discourse does not shy away from sensitive issues, including questions of race, gender, class, sexuality, politics, and religion, and neither will we. There are going to be differences in opinions, beliefs, and interpretations when we read literature, question it, and engage history and culture. You need not agree with the arguments presented in discussion threads or with what your peers or I have to say. In fact, it is important to think critically and question course material. But please do so intelligently, without the assumption that everyone agrees with you or shares your experiences. Difference is central to creating a discussion in which a variety of ideas can be exchanged and points of view can be explored. Ultimately, what is crucial to this course is that you are comfortable expressing yourself and your ideas. If, for whatever reason, you are not, then you should notify me immediately. I understand that some people are more comfortable discussing ideas, concepts, or what they have learned, than others. That said, participation augments learning. If you are not comfortable in discussion threads, as written statements that reflect your level of knowledge and comprehension, you will have difficulty getting anything out of this course. You cannot &#8220;troll&#8221; discussion threads, contributing nothing, and expect to be successful in the course learning objectives. As with many other things, you will get out of discussion what you put into it. </p>

<p><strong>Expectations for Discussion Threads:</strong></p>

<p>I expect that you will be spending anywhere from 6&#8211;8 hours each week working on the materials for the course, either through reading, the discussion threads, the Reader Responses, or essay drafting (or all four). If you are doing less than that, you’re not meeting the expectations for the class and can expect the results that come with lack of effort and engagement. </p>

<p>How much time should you spend in the discussion threads? That&#8217;s up to you. You&#8217;ll have no doubt noticed by now that the comment threads are not a graded aspect of this course. Suffice to say, you should spend at minimum two hours a week, especially if you do not have a Reader Response due, discussing the course in discussion threads. In general, the time you spend contributing to the discussion threads is the same as time you would be physically present in the classroom. </p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Discussion Climate:</strong></p>

<p>Douglas College is committed to promoting, providing, and protecting a positive, supportive, and safe working and learning environment for all its members. Students and faculty members are expected to adhere to the <a href="https://www.douglascollege.ca/~/media/4310D1BD02AE4A74B9D0832D61FA18A1.ashx">User Conduct Policy</a>. Students should alert me immediately if they have any questions about this policy and its application, or if they have concerns about course proceedings or participants. I reserve the right to exclude individuals from discussions if their conduct does not reflect the above. </p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Trigger Warning:</strong></p>

<p>In this course, we will encounter descriptive scenes that some might find unsettling&#8211;drug abuse, murder, poverty, child abuse. If at any point you feel uncomfortable being present while the material is being discussed, please feel free to remove yourself from that discussion, either before that discussion happens or, if you are caught unaware, in real time.
No explanation is needed. However, if the analysis of the course texts will be difficult enough to prevent your success in the course, please contact me by Email; discussions between you and I through Email remain private. Plot synopses of all the texts we will encounter are readily available on Wikipedia, feel free to consult the synopsis beforehand and decide if the content of this course is the right fit for you.</p>

<p><strong>Ethics Statement:</strong> </p>

<p>This course prioritizes the formal requirements of “academic writing” usually understood as proper citation, the logical development of persuasive claims, and a somewhat formal voice. You have an ethical responsibility to write at a level that reflects the absolute best of your abilities in the English language. Remember, your completed essay is a reflection of your effort. Your essays will be graded for the application of course content in the service of making a claim, grammar, vocabulary, argumentation, rhetorical style, organization, and for their attention to the rules of proper academic essay format. All of these components figure equally into your final grade.</p>

<p><strong>Academic Honesty:</strong> </p>

<p>As a student, your primary job is to demonstrate academic integrity in everything you do: the way you conduct yourself in class, the way you present your ideas in assignments, and the way you demonstrate competency during exams. Academic integrity embodies everything from treating your classmates and me with respect to coming to class prepared to citing all of your sources in your written work. Acts of academic dishonesty include, but are not limited to, plagiarism (using the ideas of another without giving credit), handing in an essay already submitted for credit in a previous class, cheating on a test or exam, allowing another person (even an editor or a tutor) to rewrite segments of your assignments, or knowingly handing in work that is not your own. I take academic dishonesty very seriously; it represents not only a failure to meet course requirements, but an act of intellectual theft and a contravention of the social contract of the college. I will fully pursue all cases of academic dishonesty, without exception. Familiarize yourself with the college’s policies on this and other relevant academic matters: <a href="http://www.douglascollege.ca/programs-courses/general-information/grading">http://www.douglascollege.ca/programs-courses/general-information/grading</a></p>

<p><strong>Peer Evaluators / Tutors:</strong> </p>

<p>While having others respond to your work outside of class can be helpful, if someone else does more than point out errors and problems and discuss corrections in a general way (if a friend, family member, or an individual solicited on-line rewrites your sentences, adds words that are not your own, or provides you with a thesis or structure for your essay) you are not learning to improve your work. Having others write all or part of your essay or assignments is plagiarism and academic dishonesty. If you are working with a tutor on your essays, you should inform me of that fact and be prepared to submit, if requested, all notes and drafts of your home essays so that I can see what kind of help you have received. Failure to do so will result in an F/0% on the assignment in question. </p>

<p>You are encouraged to use the Douglas College online tutoring service, especially if you are not able to see a tutor in person. Check the Learning Centre website for more information: <a href="http://www.douglas.bc.ca/services/learning-centre.html">http://www.douglas.bc.ca/services/learning-centre.html</a></p>

<p><strong>Statement of Responsibilities:</strong> </p>

<p>My responsibilities for this course are to introduce a wide range of examples and explanations that will illuminate the texts and guide your interpretation of them. I will also offer guidance on academic writing styles, and offer strategies for generating, organizing, and writing essays. If there is ever something you do not understand, please do not hesitate to raise questions. As well, feel free to Email me if you want clarifications, suggestions, or general guidance. However, be prepared with something to talk about, or some general ideas about your problem(s). I will not develop, write, proofread, etc., your paper for you. I encourage you to take advantage of my Email with questions should you have any problems, but I will not teach the course directly to individuals who do not participate fully in the online spaces for the course. </p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Explanation of Grading Procedures:</strong> </p>

<p>If you receive a grade you are unhappy with, or do not understand, you should make every effort to address it promptly. Do not let grades fester or take on undue gravity. I am more than willing to explain where you went wrong and give you plenty of pointers for improvement. If you do not attend to issues with your writing, you cannot expect to improve. I am never grading your work with an eye for cruelty. I am grading your work in order to show you where you stand amongst students who take&#8211;or have taken&#8211;an English literature course at Douglas College. As much as possible, try to manage your expectations where grades are concerned. The point of the course is to improve your writing. If your writing did not need improvement, or assessment in a college context, you would not be here. This course is difficult because it demands a level of writing that reflects college and university contexts, not the aptitude of your personal expression or comprehension. In this course, I am grading your writing and how you present the content of your essay. </p>

<p><strong>E-Mail:</strong></p>

<p>With the exception of holidays and weekends, I will respond to your emails within twenty-four hours. Please maintain a sense of formality in your Emails to me. I have many students in many different courses. Please tell me what course you are in and what your name is when you Email me. </p>

<p><strong>Learning Climate:</strong></p>

<p>Douglas College is committed to promoting, providing, and protecting a positive, supportive, and safe working and learning environment for all its members. Students and faculty members are expected to adhere to the <a href="https://www.douglascollege.ca/~/media/4310D1BD02AE4A74B9D0832D61FA18A1.ashx">User Conduct Policy</a>. Students should alert me immediately if they have any questions about this policy and its application, or if they have concerns about course proceedings or participants.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Course Learning Outcomes:</strong> </p>

<p>Upon completion of any first-year English literature course, the successful student should be able to:</p>

<ul>
<li>read receptively and reflectively, with sensitivity to the subtleties of language;</li>
<li>recognize and understand literary devices;</li>
<li>practice writing as a process involving pre-writing, drafting, revising and editing;</li>
<li>write an essay of literary criticism that develops an interpretive thesis supported by appropriate and correctly cited evidence; and</li>
<li>give and receive constructive criticism on written work.</li>
</ul>

<p>Upon completion of English 1102, the successful student should also be able to</p>

<ul>
<li>recognize and understand the elements of theme in literature;</li>
<li>understand and analyze the relationship of theme to other literary elements, such as plot, character, setting, figurative language and irony; and</li>
<li>recognize and appreciate connections between the theme(s) studied in the course and social issues.</li>
<li>recognize the characteristics of figurative language (such as imagery, metaphor and symbolism)</li>
</ul>

<hr />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>English 1102 (Online) Activity Prompt #1 - Week 1<br/>
Complete by Jan. 11th
Winter 2017 - Douglas College - David N. Wright</strong> </p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Preamble</strong></p>

<p>This is the first in what will usually be a weekly &#8220;activity prompt&#8221; that I include in the course module to get the discussion thread going. These activity prompts are for everyone in the course to complete and discuss on the discussion thread for the week&#8217;s course module. You will need to be able to discuss what you learned from completing the activity prompt, especially how it influenced your reading of the texts we&#8217;ll be covering in the course. Suffice to say, most will find it extremely helpful to approach these activity prompts with a degree of formality: </p>

<ol>
<li>Write down your responses to the activity prompt&#8217;s questions</li>
<li>When completing the activity prompt, always relate your thinking to the text(s) we&#8217;re covering&#8211;don&#8217;t just &#8220;do it,&#8221; think about how the activity is enhancing&#8211;or detracting&#8211;from your experience of reading, interpretation, or understanding literary effect (character traits, symbols, metaphors, atmosphere, etc.).</li>
<li>If you cannot physically complete the prompt, imagine what it would be like to do it and come up with responses based on how you imagine the experience of completing the activity prompt.</li>
</ol>

<p>As I note in the course outline and expectations, I will set up a weekly discussion thread in Blackboard to facilitate discussion around the activity prompt. I&#8217;ll check in on the discussion thread once or twice a week and discuss the activity prompts with those who are in the thread. Alternatively, you can discuss the activity prompts amongst yourselves&#8211;or take the conversation in another direction of more interest to you&#8211;by setting up your own discussion thread (check the Blackboard tutorials if you want help doing this). </p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Task:</strong></p>

<p>Sometime before January 11th, visit a real, physical, brick and mortar, bookstore, any bookstore <strong>other than</strong> the Douglas College bookstore. Maybe there&#8217;s a bookstore in the area where you live, or in a mall near you, or somewhere you&#8217;re visiting&#8211;go there. Make a special trip if you have to&#8211;visit a bookstore you&#8217;ve heard about but never been to, or one you find using google maps. When you are visiting, pay attention to your surroundings and answer the following questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>What&#8217;s in a bookstore? Books obviously, but what else? What kinds of books? What are the topics? Are they big books, small books, giant books, kid&#8217;s books? What&#8217;s in a bookstore that isn&#8217;t a book? How are the items in a bookstore related to each other? How does the store organize its items?</li>
<li>What kind of a building is the bookstore in? What does the building look like? How do the surroundings both inside and outside the bookstore suggest &#8220;bookstore&#8221;?</li>
<li>What&#8217;s the name of the bookstore? How does the name reflect&#8211;or not&#8211;what&#8217;s inside the bookstore?</li>
<li>Who&#8217;s working at the bookstore? What do they look like? What are they wearing? How might they look the part of working in a bookstore?</li>
<li>Which of your senses are triggered in the bookstore (smell, touch, taste, etc.)? How are your senses triggered&#8211;what specific items bring them on? What do your senses tell you about where you are?</li>
</ol>

<hr />

<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>

<p>Be as specific as possible with your answers&#8211;name actual things, be precise about details. Think carefully about what the bookstore is trying to achieve: How is it selling you books? How is it staging the &#8220;experience&#8221; of reading? How is it organizing your interaction with the items inside it? How much do you need to know about a bookstore to navigate a bookstore? What exactly do you need to know about a bookstore to navigate a bookstore or find a book? </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>English 1102 (Online) Activity Prompt #2 - Week 2<br/>
Complete by Jan. 18th<br/>
Winter 2017 - Douglas College - David N. Wright</strong> </p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Preamble</strong></p>

<p>This is the second in what will usually be a weekly &#8220;activity prompt&#8221; that I include in the course module to get the discussion thread going. These activity prompts are for everyone in the course to complete and discuss on the discussion thread for the week&#8217;s course module.

Suffice to say, most will find it extremely helpful to approach these activity prompts with a degree of formality: </p>

<ol>
<li>Write down your responses to the activity prompt&#8217;s questions</li>
<li>When completing the activity prompt, always relate your thinking to the text(s) we&#8217;re covering&#8211;don&#8217;t just &#8220;do it,&#8221; think about how the activity is enhancing&#8211;or detracting&#8211;from your experience of reading, interpretation, or understanding literary effect (character traits, symbols, metaphors, atmosphere, etc.).</li>
<li>If you cannot physically complete the prompt, imagine what it would be like to do it and come up with responses based on how you imagine the experience of completing the activity prompt.</li>
</ol>

<p>As I note in the course outline and expectations, I will set up a weekly discussion thread in Blackboard to facilitate discussion around the activity prompt. I&#8217;ll check in on the discussion thread once or twice a week and discuss the activity prompts with those who are in the thread. Alternatively, you can discuss the activity prompts amongst yourselves&#8211;or take the conversation in another direction of more interest to you&#8211;by setting up your own discussion thread (check the Blackboard tutorials if you want help doing this). </p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Outcomes Statement:</strong> This activity prompt is designed to get you thinking about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_(arts)">Character</a> and how literary devices rely on our cultural assumptions&#8211;our learned assumptions about the world&#8211;to make meaning. Make sure you have read the lecture for week one, and done all the required readings about literary terms on the <a href="http://digitalcultureslab.ca/douglascollege-online1102/winter2017/course-schedule-and-readings-full/">course schedule</a> before you enter into the discussion thread.</p>

<p><strong>Task:</strong></p>

<p>Sometime before January 18th, do some research (on the internet mostly) on the artist called Banksy. Spend some time&#8211;maybe an hour or so&#8211;and read the Wikipedia page, look at the art, read some statements, feel your way around the different contexts, following links as your curiosity, and time, allows. </p>

<p>Banksy is anonymous, but does have a particular style. What personality traits do you imagine when you picture Banksy? Make a list of the character traits you see when you visualize Banksy and share at least three of those traits, with a brief justification for each, in your contribution to the discussion thread for &#8220;Activity Prompt #2 - Character and Banksy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Some things to think about:</p>

<ol>
<li>What gender is Banksy? What proof do you have that Banksy is male or female or something else? What assumptions are you making about Banksy&#8217;s gender based on what you have learned about Banksy?</li>
<li>How do Banksy&#8217;s character traits fit into a larger category? What category is that and how does knowing the category help us imagine Banksy&#8217;s traits and what they might mean? By categories, I mean does Banksy belong to the category of an artist? street punk? savvy entrepreneur? Is Banksy married? emotional? ironic? thoughtful?</li>
<li>Ask yourself, how do I imagine Banksy walking down the street? Why do I imagine it that way?</li>
<li>How does nationality affect how we see Banksy as a character? What&#8217;s Banksy&#8217;s race? Does this matter to how we imagine Banksy?</li>
<li>There are some images, texts, and sounds available online that are supposedly Banksy the person. How do these representations fit a stereotype or match&#8211;or resist&#8211;our expectations for Banksy&#8217;s gender, mannerisms, political stance, etc.?</li>
<li>What&#8217;s in a name? What does the name &#8220;Banksy&#8221; mean? What are the connotations? How does the name &#8220;Banksy&#8221; shape how we imagine Banksy the person?</li>
</ol>

<hr />

<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>

<p>As always, be as specific as possible with your answers&#8211;name actual character traits&#8211;gait, teeth, skin-type, hair, body parts, mannerisms, gestures, fashion, jewelry; be precise about details. </p>

<p>Try to connect what you&#8217;re discovering about how you imagine Banksy to assumptions you might be making about the characters in <em>Mr. Penumbra&#8217;s 24-Hour Bookstore.</em> For example, what does the name &#8220;Kat Potente&#8221; mean? What category does Kat belong to, and how does that category affect how we understand or imagine her? (Remember, gender is a category.) What does the name &#8220;Clay Jannon&#8221; mean? What category does Clay belong to, and how does it affect how we imagine or understand him? Do these characters belong to a particular genre of literature? How so? </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Winter 2017 - English 1102.090 - Douglas College
David N. Wright</strong>

<hr />

<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> </p>

<p>The first two full modules in this course involve a lot of reading, I won&#8217;t nag you, but please do make sure you have done the reading and have a good grasp of the key literary terms listed on the <a href="http://digitalcultureslab.ca/douglascollege-online1102/winter2017/course-schedule-and-readings-full/">course schedule</a>. Make sure you read the definitions of literary terminology carefully, and think about how you might use them to help you describe and explain how writing works to &#8220;make meaning.&#8221; Otherwise, the lectures will not make sense&#8211;the lectures feed off your reading; they cannot be understood well in isolation from the readings. </p>

<p>The activity prompts and Reader Response Blog Posts will invite you to apply some of the approaches and concepts in the lectures (like the one below). Try to apply the reading in the discussion threads and the blog posts as much as possible. You&#8217;re learning in this course is a negotiation between the lectures and the application of the skill-sets, definitions, and approaches outlined therein to the other online spaces of the course.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Why Call it a Text?</strong></p>

<p>In this course, we will often refer to the novel, poem, movie, song, game, etc., as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_(literary_theory)">&#8220;text.&#8221;</a> We won&#8217;t usually call it a &#8220;novel&#8221; or a &#8220;poem&#8221; or &#8220;movie.&#8221; We&#8217;re doing this because we always want to move beyond the expectations of genre or literature to think about how reading helps us understand the world. Many of the interpretive strategies we&#8217;ll use in the course apply to things outside literary study. As the Wikipedia link for &#8220;text&#8221; noted above suggests, &#8220;a text is any object that can be &#8216;read,&#8217; whether this object is a work of literature, a street sign, an arrangement of buildings on a city block, or styles of clothing. It is a coherent set of signs that transmits some kind of informative message.&#8221; Learning about the tools, processes, and approaches that allow us to interpret that message&#8211;and all its different modes (delivery, style, symbolism, assumptions)&#8211;is what this course is all about. </p>

<p>For example, if you are a doctor diagnosing a patient, you does not simply declare: &#8220;you have the flu!!&#8221; That would be terrifying. Instead, we review symptoms by taking into account aspects of the patient&#8217;s lifestyle (character traits), where she lives (setting), his body type (genre), habits, genealogy, his past, among many other things. Once we take into account all these particulars, and &#8220;read&#8221; the patient, we come to a diagnosis. We avoid generalized assumptions in favour or details, patterns, and potential contradictions.</p>

<p>One way to think about what we&#8217;re doing in this course is to say: we&#8217;re diagnosing meaning in texts. We don&#8217;t necessarily want to restrict ourselves to thinking only about what a novel might mean. Or, we want to think about symbols, characters, settings that we see in texts as texts in-and-of-themselves&#8211;how they work on their own outside the novel or poem in which we encounter them. Point is, we&#8217;re about details not about assumptions. By speaking to &#8220;texts,&#8221; we hopefully eliminate some of the assumptions we make about genre and the act of reading; or at least we create a space to talk about some of those assumptions and why we make them. </p>

<p>What we need to think about, and ultimately write essays, blog posts, and comments about, is how texts make meaning. Not what they <em>are</em> but what pieces make them up and how do these pieces add up to something (and what is the nature of that &#8220;something&#8221; anyway?). </p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Making Meaning:</strong></p>

<p>Making meaning is something I will refer to often in this course. Essentially, I want to point you in the direction of analysis rather than synopsis. Often, we discuss the plot events of literary texts, or other cultural phenomena, as a way of trying to understand them. Discussing plot events is really about comprehension, which is something we need to do but that we need to move on from quite quickly. </p>

<p>It&#8217;s most important to figure out how a text &#8220;makes meaning.&#8221; How does the text represent what it does? How does it make us feel things? How does it trigger an awareness in us? How does it make us sympathetic&#8211;or not&#8211;with particular characters? </p>

<p>We often make assumptions about a text&#8217;s meaning without really thinking about where that meaning comes from. Why, for instance, do we tend to like books that are &#8220;realistic&#8221;? What do we mean when we say that a text is realistic? What makes it so? What does it do that makes it appear realistic? Plots, or storylines, often are not realistic in the sense that most of us will not experience&#8211;or want to experience&#8211;what characters might experience. At the same time, we want to feel like we <em>could</em> experience things that the characters do; otherwise, it feels false. </p>

<p>So, what we&#8217;re interested in doing is determining what a text is about in order to understand how it makes meaning for readers. The way we can talk about this process is to use literary terminology, which gets us to label specifics. We need to discuss the specifics of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_(arts)">character</a>&#8211;something the <a href="http://digitalcultureslab.ca/douglascollege-online1102/winter2017/activity-prompt-2/">activity prompt</a> for this module, about Banksy, gets you to do. We also need to account for our expectations from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genre">genre</a>&#8211;we don&#8217;t expect a novel to read like a play; a poem to read like a novel. When we account for intricacies, as well as the assumptions we make about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Setting_(narrative)">setting</a>, or the locale in which the story is set, then we can address how the text makes meaning for us&#8211;how it delivers and diverts from our expectations. </p>

<p>At the same time, we need to account for who is doing the speaking, or who has what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narration#Narrative_point_of_view">point-of-view</a>, in the novel or the poem or the play, or even the cultural statement&#8211;who are we, as an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audience">audience</a> focused on and to what ends? How does that speaker or point-of-view organize the events of the story; how do they structure the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrative_structure">narrative</a> to emphasize or foreshadow or minimize? How does the narrative emphasize the actions of one character over another? How does it contrast settings in order to convey different outlooks? </p>

<p>When we combine the above approaches together, we get at the heart of how the text makes meaning. Take for example <a href="http://digitalcultureslab.ca/douglascollege-online1102/winter2017/activity-prompt-1/">Activity Prompt #1</a>, which asked you to visit a bookstore. That activity is all about understanding <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Setting_(narrative)">setting</a> and how our expectations for the bookstore in <em>Mr. Penumbra&#8217;s 24-Hour Bookstore</em> are set in motion by how the real world represents bookstores. Some of you loved the smell of bookstores. Reading <em>Mr. Penumbra&#8217;s 24-Hour Bookstore</em>, we cannot actually smell the bookstore (even though there&#8217;s a chapter titled &#8220;The Smell of Books&#8221; (63)), but somehow the description of the bookstore elicits that smell. How does it do that? Are there words that trigger that smell&#8211;what are those words? Is it the type of bookstore that is being described&#8211;how exactly is it described? How is your own love of the &#8220;smell of bookstores&#8221; creeping into your imagining of the bookstore&#8211;how does the book appeal to bookstore-lovers? How do other bookstores you&#8217;ve seen inform how you imagine <em>Mr. Penumbra&#8217;s 24-Hour Bookstore</em>&#8211;how is the text play to your assumptions and expectations?</p>

<p>When we push a little further, we might discuss how <em>Mr. Penumbra&#8217;s 24-Hour Bookstore</em> highlights a particular kind of bookstore. This isn&#8217;t a <em>Chapters</em> or <em>Indigo</em> or <em>Barnes and Noble</em>. How is it different? What does that mean? How is the book foregrounding the <em>idea</em> or bookstores? How is it <em>idealizing</em> bookstores? What do the answers to these questions do to how we understand or imagine <em>Mr. Penumbra&#8217;s 24-Hour Bookstore</em>?</p>

<p>Then, we can push even further: for those of you who do some reading on your kindle or iPad or equivalent. How is the &#8220;shelf&#8221; represented in your device? Why is it represented at all? It&#8217;s not a real shelf, or is it? Even the books are rendered as &#8220;books.&#8221; They have a &#8220;page flip.&#8221; But, none of this is real. These things are all designed to &#8220;signal&#8221; real books in a virtual space. But, they didn&#8217;t include a little scent-jet that shoots out the smell of books. Why not!?!? Why were the choices made the way they were&#8211;what emphasized or downplayed to &#8220;enhance your experience&#8221;?</p>

<p>These are some of the ways that a text&#8211;and the tools we use to read them&#8211;can enrich our understanding of the spaces we encounter in our everyday lives. Everything we encounter (people, places, objects) is to some degree being read by us, our assumptions, and our expectations. The trick we&#8217;re trying to learn in this course is how to figure out where those assumptions and expectations come from, along with the different features of the literary texts (character, setting, genre, narrative structure, point-of-view) that manipulate or emphasize our assumptions and expectations as readers. How does the text make meaning?</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Specifics:</strong></p>

<p>As you can probably tell from the above, doing literary criticism is all about specifics. We need to avoid generalizations and work from specific examples. This practice is often referred to as <a href="http://writingcenter.fas.harvard.edu/pages/how-do-close-reading">close reading</a>. What we want to do is start with specifics&#8211;words, repetitions, and patterns&#8211;then make a claim about how those specifics work to make meaning. </p>

<p>We wouldn&#8217;t want as a starting point to say that Clay Jannon represents the stereotypical lazy hipster who does nothing all day. He might well represent such a thing, but we want details! What about him exactly makes him seem that way? What <em>words</em>, what <em>repeated actions</em>, what <em>symbols</em>? Once we establish all the elements that go into Clay&#8217;s character, then maybe we might say that he is a lazy hipster who does nothing all day. We have examples to point to that allow us to make such a claim though; we&#8217;re not just saying it. </p>

<p>Once we do that, then we can do the other fun stuff: like suggest that his lazy hipster character is the perfect type to set out on a coming of age quest for knowledge. We&#8217;re more sympathetic with him because he is a lovable loser. After we detail the bookstore, we might see how it stands in contrast to Google&#8230; but we would be able to analyze that contrast and see how it manipulates us to create suspense in the book. Or, how it prioritizes bookstores over technology from the beginning, foreshadowing the ending. </p>

<p>There&#8217;s lots of places to go with interpretation, and don&#8217;t worry if you cannot get there right away. The real takeaway for this module is simply to understand that: </p>

<ul>
<li>we use literary terms to focus our attention on details that make meaning in the text</li>
<li>we need to use literary terms to help us describe how we are imagining the text</li>
<li>we bring assumptions and expectations to a text, and we should account for that when we talk about what the text means</li>
<li>we work with specifics&#8211;specific details from inside the text</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, go and do <a href="http://digitalcultureslab.ca/douglascollege-online1102/winter2017/activity-prompt-2/">Activity Prompt #2</a> (hint: it&#8217;s all about how we understand&#8211;or try to understand&#8211;character).</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>English 1102 (Online) Activity Prompt #3 - Week 3<br/>
Complete by Jan. 25th<br/>
Winter 2017 - Douglas College - David N. Wright</strong> </p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Outcomes Statement:</strong> This activity prompt is designed to get you thinking about symbol and how symbol shapes how we understand story events, character motivations (hidden or apparent), and our cultural assumptions about what objects represent (or &#8220;mean something&#8221;). </p>

<p><strong>Task:</strong></p>

<p>Sometime before January 27th, pick out your favourite <a href="https://www.fastcodesign.com/3028971/whats-the-difference-between-a-font-and-a-typeface">typeface / font</a>. You can search the internet for a typeface or, using word processing software such as Word or Pages, pick one that&#8217;s already on your computer. </p>

<p>Once you have chosen your typeface, think about and discuss why you chose that typeface. What does it represent to you? What are the specific characteristics of the typeface that drew you to choose it? Be specific and point to the particulars of the typeface and how those particulars mean something. </p>

<p>Some things to think about:</p>

<ol>
<li>What assumptions do you make about your reader&#8217;s enjoyment of the typeface? What role does the reader play in guiding your choice?</li>
<li>How does the typeface you chose fit into a larger category of typefaces (sans serif, script, web ready)? How does the category shape the typeface and how it looks to you or to readers?</li>
<li>What&#8217;s in a name? How is the name of the typeface important? How is the name symbolic of the typeface?</li>
<li>Think about the objects named and handled (the theatrical among you might want to think of the word &#8220;props&#8221;) by characters in <em>Mr. Penumbra&#8217;s 24-Hour Bookstore</em>. How are these objects representative of character traits? Like you did with the typeface you chose, try to explain and point to the specific connections between object (typeface) and character (you / reader).</li>
</ol>

<hr />

<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>

<p>This activity is trying to get you to examine the details of something in order to figure out what the object might represent. For example, if we want to suggest that Clay is a symbol in <em>Mr. Penumbra&#8217;s 24-Hour Bookstore</em>, then we need to explain how, precisely, he is symbolic by relating it to examples in the text. We need to connect his character to something symbolic, or some symbolic outcome, in the novel. </p>

<p>Let&#8217;s take as an example Clay&#8217;s name. It might be symbolic as a quite literal representation of his stasis in the novel&#8211;he doesn&#8217;t seem to be going anywhere, stuck in a routine, unable to &#8220;flow.&#8221; At the same time, he is malleable, able to take on numerous roles, a bit of a changeling, sometimes shaped heavily by others. There&#8217;s lots of examples in the text that would illustrate those symbolic characteristics. If we point to examples of his actions in the text, then we can start to see how his name is symbolic of how we are supposed to &#8220;read&#8221;&#8211;or understand&#8211;his character, and the traits that go along with &#8220;making meaning&#8221; in that character. </p>

<p>If we dig a little deeper though, and we say Clay&#8217;s name out loud, we hear &#8220;clé&#8221;&#8211;the French word for &#8220;key.&#8221; Given that Clay is the &#8220;key&#8221; to solving the riddle of the novel, his name is symbolic on another level as well. Point is, we need to think about all the details of a character&#8217;s name&#8211;auditory and literal in the two examples here&#8211;to decipher the particulars of his symbolic role in the novel. Culturally, we might say that Clay is symbolic of &#8220;hipsters&#8221; or &#8220;Millennials.&#8221; Doing so, however, relies on our cultural knowledge and assumptions about the characteristics&#8211;or the specifics inside the general categories&#8211;of those groups. Yet another way to understand how the text &#8220;makes meaning&#8221; through symbols.</p>

<p>Thinking about typefaces is a good way to practice getting at the above. Imagine the typeface you chose as a symbol, or character, that represents <strong>things</strong>. What are those things it represents, what do they mean, and where does that meaning come from? Once we decipher all that, we can better understand how the typeface itself, before one even writes or reads a word, &#8220;makes meaning.&#8221; All of which is good practice for figuring out what parts of <em>Mr. Penumbra&#8217;s 24-Hour Bookstore</em> go into giving the book meaning.</p>

David N. Wright</strong>

<p>In the last lecture, I noted that &#8220;Making meaning is something I will refer to often in this course. Essentially, I want to point you in the direction of analysis rather than synopsis. Often, we discuss the plot events of literary texts, or other cultural phenomena, as a way of trying to understand them. Discussing plot events is really about comprehension, which is something we need to do but that we need to move on from quite quickly.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s some clarification: </p>

<p>The <a href="http://digitalcultureslab.ca/douglascollege-online1102/winter2017/course-schedule-and-readings-full/">readings</a> for this week focus on figurative language or, terminology we need in order to discuss the higher order of signification that language can create. The bottom line is that interpretation, as far as this class is concerned, involves two stages: 1) read for comprehension; 2) read for symbolic, metaphoric, or imagistic meaning. </p>

<p>You might remember in high school being taught things such as simile or metaphor. Simile is easy to remember for most&#8211;it&#8217;s a comparison using &#8220;like&#8221; or &#8220;as.&#8221; When you read a simile, try to pay attention to how the comparison using like or as is constructed. What is being compared to what, and then how is one thing &#8220;like&#8221; another? If you read that a character &#8220;stands tall like a tree,&#8221; then you need to think about the specific qualities that a tree has which are transferred onto that character. It&#8217;s not enough to simply point to the simile, we need to explain how it works and why is it&#8211;or isn&#8217;t&#8211;effective. Let&#8217;s look at a few examples from Chapters 1 - 3 of <em>Mr. Penumbra&#8217;s 24-Hour Bookstore</em>.</p>

<p>“The whole economy suddenly felt like a game of musical chairs, and I was convinced I needed to grab a seat, any seat, as fast as I could.”</p>

<ul>
<li>Here the comparison is pretty straightforward. The economy is unstable and you need to grab anything you can get. What&#8217;s important for us to emphasize is how one needs to know how to play musical chairs&#8211;so there&#8217;s some Western cultural knowledge needed to understand the comparison. At the same time, the nature of the comparison refers to a children&#8217;s game suggesting that Clay is not a deep thinker&#8211;he tends to express himself through simple comparisons&#8211;not that there&#8217;s anything wrong with this. Finally, the comparison also reveals much about the anxieties this character is feeling and hints at his need for stability and his tendency to be self-centred in his outlook. In short, there&#8217;s a lot to be taken from the simile.</li>
</ul>

<p>“The shelves were packed close together, and it felt like I was standing at the border of a forest—not a friendly California forest, either, but an old Transylvanian forest, a forest full of wolves and witches and dagger-wielding bandits all waiting just beyond moonlight’s reach.”</p>

<ul>
<li>Let&#8217;s do the stages. Stage 1 (the literal or reading for comprehension stage): The narrator (Clay) is comparing the shelves of the bookstore to a forest. It&#8217;s important to note here that I didn&#8217;t write &#8220;bookstore,&#8221; but &#8220;shelves.&#8221; That he focuses on the shelves is an important distinction. The comparison here is double-edged: it&#8217;s both simile and metaphor (more on that later). I&#8217;m not &#8220;reading into&#8221; the simile yet. I&#8217;m just getting clear on what is being compared to what. To focus on the simile, we need to be precise about what is being compared: shelves and a forest. Stage 2: the shelves are the kind of forest that one wouldn&#8217;t want to enter into&#8211;a scary forest, one with a lot of references to horror images or fairly-tale images (Dracula, wolves, witches, daggers). The simile then relies on what I know of such horror or fairy-tale things, and how I know they are there to teach us something and that they themselves often mean more than what&#8217;s on the surface (and there&#8217;s the metaphor bit I&#8217;ll get to in a moment). In sum, the simile here works to show us how intimidated Clay is about reading what&#8217;s on the shelf, how he again emphasizes a child-like approach to expressing his emotions&#8211;wolves, scary monsters, dark forests. We&#8217;re building an understanding of his character through these similes.</li>
</ul>

<p>“The perfect independent bookstore, like Pygmalion in Berkeley.”</p>

<ul>
<li>Here&#8217;s a direct comparison that allows us to visualize the bookstore as a whole: &#8220;Pygmalion&#8221; Have you looked this up on Google? Does it exist? What&#8217;s really important is to see how we again, like in the example above have a reference to California. A lot of the similes are built around a knowledge of California, which contains not only &#8220;friendly forests&#8221; but also &#8220;perfect independent bookstores.&#8221; Point is, California seems to be a place that Clay sees as a &#8220;safe space,&#8221; somewhere he thinks is not scary and that he feels comfortable with&#8211;which tells us something about his worldview.</li>
</ul>

<p>“Every night I take his place, and we nod farewell like soldiers—like men who uniquely understand each other’s circumstances.”</p>

<ul>
<li>Think carefully about the implications of this simile: how do soldiers nod farewell? What does this mean? Are they going to die? Is there an army somewhere? How does this simile foreshadow or imply something about the relationship between characters?</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>Ok, metaphor. Metaphor was famously defined, probably by Aristotle but who knows, as <em>finding the similar in the dissimilar</em>. Some like to see metaphor as simply a comparison that does not rely on &#8220;like&#8221; or &#8220;as.&#8221; Problem is that, as noted above, some metaphors shelter a related or unrelated simile within them. Anyway you want to look at it, when something represents something other than the literal meaning, it&#8217;s a metaphor or symbol or it&#8217;s ironic. Point is, you should look at it and contemplate. </p>

<p>&#8220;The boat plows through the water&#8221; is a good example of a metaphor. The <em>plow</em> belongs on land, the <em>boat</em> in the water (the dissimilar), but the &#8220;similarity&#8221; of the action (&#8220;plowing&#8221;) creates a vivid image of what&#8217;s happening. If we look at the forest described above, &#8220;not a friendly California forest, either, but an old Transylvanian forest, a forest full of wolves and witches and dagger-wielding bandits all waiting just beyond moonlight’s reach,&#8221; we can decipher the metaphor(s) at work. The qualities of this forest speak to fears&#8211;both reasonable and unreasonable&#8211;but they are not literal fears&#8211;a bookshelf is not a forest, scary or otherwise. At the same time though, the metaphor speaks to Clay&#8217;s unreasonable, child-like fear or books. Remember, we&#8217;re talking about a time when &#8220;he rarely touched paper.&#8221; He&#8217;s clearly got some issues around reading things on a shelf, and he articulates that through references to fairly-tales, forests, and other highly metaphoric, moralizing stories. </p>

<p>The point is that Clay&#8217;s character develops through his descriptions of things, particularly what he compares those things to. His emphasis on big bad forests with mean wolves and witches from Transylvania suggest that he hasn&#8217;t really developed much maturity around experiences and doesn&#8217;t really have the language to describe unknowns or unreasonable fears. At the same time, he really likes California and sees it as a safe space&#8211;which is weird when on considers that California, and the Hollywood we associated with it, is responsible for our modern conception of &#8220;big bad forests with mean wolves and witches from Transylvania.&#8221; The references to California also serve to reinforce his connection, at least in the beginning, with the technological optimism of Silicon Valley. In short, readers are being set up to believe that Clay is afraid of books (with their stories about &#8220;big bad forests with mean wolves and witches from Transylvania,&#8221; but admires Google (California).</p>

<p>These similes and metaphors (symbols!) also keeps us&#8211;readers&#8211;implicated in the story as we wait to see how he will sort all this out. The book uses Clay&#8217;s connections to objects, his descriptions of setting, objects, people, and his characterizations of his emotional responses to &#8220;make meaning.&#8221;</p>

<hr />

<p>Phew, let&#8217;s tackle something a little more straightforward: genre. The important thing to remember about genre is conventions&#8211;how a particular genre signals&#8211;or represents&#8211;conventions. We know what a novel is because we understand the conventions of the genre, same with poetry, or a television sitcom, or a detective story. Sometimes, genres are about the <em>type</em> of text we are reading: a novel, a poem, a play. Sometimes, genres respond the other literary terms such as character, atmosphere, or even generalized conventions. Detective fiction is a <em>genre</em> in that it has conventions we expect to see when we read it&#8211;namely a detective and, usually, a dead body. A fairy tale is a genre often signalled by the words &#8220;once upon a time.&#8221; Point is, we have expectations for what we are reading that are based on the conventions we perceive when we arrive at the text. </p>

<p>We might refer to these conventions as &#8220;normative.&#8221; The conventions are what we expect in a &#8220;normal&#8221; novel, poem, character, setting, symbol, etc. One way to do literary analysis is to look at how texts assert&#8211;or resist&#8211;convention and what that does for how the text &#8220;makes meaning.&#8221; For example, a stop sign that was painted green instead of red and had the word &#8220;GO&#8221; written inside it but still stood at an intersection might give some of us pause. Are we meant to stop? It looks like a stop sign, but it&#8217;s the wrong colour. Can I roll through? What&#8217;s coming the other way? Is there a stop sign the other way, or one of these signs? In short, the issue with a green-GO stop sign is that it defies convention&#8211;it still has the octagonal shape and position we expect from a stop sign (the convention), but the colour and the words are unexpected, and it throws us. The normative function of the stop sign (to make us stop) is thrown into chaos by the challenge to convention (the green and the word &#8220;GO&#8221;). </p>

<img src="http://digitalcultureslab.ca/douglascollege-online1102/winter2017/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/stop_sign_go.png" alt="" width="640" height="480" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-134" />

<p>We always want to think about what the normative symbol means&#8211;what we think the character is trying to represent, or what the setting is referring to, or how the story is using objects. Once we do that, we can better see how the text might be playing with those conventions, or being ambiguous about the meaning of those conventions, or how the object signals those conventions. In short, we&#8217;re looking both at how the literary text has objects (things, characters, settings, words) <em>like</em> things we know about in the real world, things we <em>expect</em> to see, and has objects&#8211;sometimes the same as we expect, sometimes not&#8211;that <em>are not like</em> things we know in the real world, or things we <em>expect</em> to see. </p>

<p>Genre is an important term because it helps us lay out what our expectations are so that we can better discuss how the text &#8220;makes meaning&#8221; by taking our expectations into account. The text might play with those conventions or distort them, or offer &#8220;non-normative&#8221; representations in order to foreshadow, make a point, keep us in suspense, take us in the wrong direction, or to enlighten us about the very expectations we might not recognize we have. </p>

<p>If we take <em>Mr. Penumbra&#8217;s 24-Hour Bookstore</em> as an example, it is a pretty conventional novel. In fact, it signals many conventions: it&#8217;s quest narrative (like many epic poems, it recounts a journey), it&#8217;s a coming of age story (again, a journey from ignorance to understanding), it&#8217;s a mystery novel (what are all those characters reading?), it&#8217;s a romance (will Clay get together with Kat?). At the same time, it defies some of these conventions by emphasizing technology, youth-culture, and unexpected outcomes. What we need to figure out, and discuss, is why is defies those conventions and how the text comments on the &#8220;normative&#8221; world by giving us an imaginary one. </p>

<p>You might want to think about some of the following going forward to the next module:</p>

<ul>
<li>Who is left out of <em>Mr. Penumbra&#8217;s 24-Hour Bookstore</em>? How does the text play into conventions of representation by leaving out character types (by race, gender, or sex)?</li>
<li>What language does the text use when representing technological things? What adjectives surround these technological objects? How do these words correspond to the current normative language about technology we see in the real world (on TV, the internet, in an Apple store)?</li>
</ul>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>English 1102 (Online) Activity Prompt #4 - Week 4<br/>
Complete by Feb. 1st<br/>
Winter 2017 - Douglas College - David N. Wright</strong> </p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Outcomes Statement:</strong> This activity prompt is designed to get you thinking about how <em>JPod</em> uses literature to comment on how consumption is infused into our understanding of the world.</p>

<p><strong>Task:</strong></p>

<p>Sometime before February 1st, pick an advertisement for a restaurant you think is particularly compelling&#8211;make sure it&#8217;s the advertisement that is compelling, not the restaurant. Examine what it is in the advertisement that makes the restaurant look appealing (or not). </p>

<p>Some things to think about:</p>

<ol>
<li>What assumptions do you make about what the restaurant serves?</li>
<li>How do your expectations (what you want to eat) influence the kind of advertisement you are drawn to?</li>
<li>What larger category does the restaurant fit into and how do the objects (images <em>and</em> text) in the advertisement signal that category?</li>
<li>What details does the advertisement leave out? (It&#8217;s easy to see what&#8217;s in the image or the text of the advertisement, but what doesn&#8217;t the advertisement speak about or represent? Does it show a picture of two people bug-eyed at the bill? Or seated next to the bathroom?)</li>
<li>How does the advertisement appeal to you? Is it a character speaking? Who is it? A setting (picture of the restaurant)? Where in the restaurant? Is it a mood? How is that set? A metaphor? What&#8217;s being contrasted / compared? What precisely is the advertisement selling (hint: it&#8217;s rarely the restaurant itself but the particulars of &#8220;an experience.&#8221; We need to think about the details (objects) that signal what kind of experience it is).</li>
<li>How does Douglas Coupland&#8217;s novel invite us to consume it? How does the novel speak to food? How does the novel represent advertisements, consumerism, consumption more generally?</li>
</ol>

<hr />

<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>

<p>This activity is trying to get you to examine the details of an advertisement in order to make some sense of the visual cues in <em>JPod</em>. <em>JPod</em> is a difficult text for most readers, because it is a mix of visual metaphors (the outside of a ramen noodle package) and a self-referential narrative (the text begins by referencing the author). However, it is important to remember that like <em>Mr. Penumbra&#8217;s 24-Hour Bookstore</em>, <em>JPod</em> is representing a reality to us. It has themes, points of emphasis, human-like characters, settings. There&#8217;s nothing in the text we do not experience or that we cannot imagine. That said, Douglas Coupland&#8217;s text is doing something quite different than <em>Mr. Penumbra&#8217;s 24-Hour Bookstore</em>. So, one of the things we&#8217;re trying to do now is key in on a theme&#8211;consumption in this case&#8211;is represented in the text. In the next module on <em>JPod</em>, we&#8217;ll do the same thing but with setting (Vancouver!). </p>

<p>The above activity is trying to demystify the act of interpretation. If we stick with trying to understand <em>what</em> we are experiencing in <em>JPod</em> rather than the <em>why</em> we are experiencing it, the text has some interesting things to say about the nature of consumption, authorship, consumerism, and popular culture (all themes!). We don&#8217;t have to read texts looking for reasons why they were written, or authorial motivations. Most of the time, we need to read them to see how they represent the experience of living&#8211;whether we have lived that way of not. Again, it&#8217;s all about what you visualize and how you visualize&#8211;or imagine&#8211;the text in your head. Try to think about how that image in your head comes to be and what it might mean. If you&#8217;re confused, what is it that&#8217;s making you confused in the text? When are you not confused? Then, examine the differences to get at what the text is trying to represent (it might be confusion!). If you took all the scenes in <em>JPod</em> where food was mentioned, or characters were eating, what could you say about how the text &#8220;makes meaning&#8221; and comments on the nature of consumerism?</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Winter 2017 – English 1102.090 – Douglas College  
David N. Wright</strong>

<p>This week&#8217;s module lecture is more a demo than a lecture. We&#8217;re finishing up with <em>Mr. Penumbra&#8217;s 24-Hour Bookstore</em> and moving into <em>JPod</em>, so a little pulling together is needed before we set off into the next text. If you&#8217;ve been following along with the lectures, doing the reading, and attempting the Activity Prompts, you should have a pretty good grasp of how literary terms are used to help examine how a text makes meaning. As we move through this week&#8217;s online lecture, I want to reiterate how we can use literary terms to help us interpret texts. </p>

<p>First off, literary terms such as character, narrative, metaphor, symbol, etc., are really about establishing our assumptions for what those things mean. At the same time, having definitions for these things allows us to visualize what a basic or &#8220;normative&#8221; character might be, or a &#8220;normative&#8221; symbol might look like. We read about a rose and think of love; see a black figure in a dark room and think something is about to happen that won&#8217;t be good. In short, we need to establish our expectations&#8211;what we assume something will mean&#8211;and then see how that plays off what it means in the text. Sometimes, our expectations and the representations will align&#8211;as Gertrude Stein famously said: &#8220;a rose is a rose is a rose,&#8221; suggesting there is sometimes no meaning beyond what we expect an object to be at face value. However, there are <em>often</em> times in a text where the representation and our expectation <em>do not</em> align. It&#8217;s in these moments of non-alignment that we want to dive in. </p>

<p>In order to recognize these spaces where representation and expectation don&#8217;t necessarily align, we need to do some close reading&#8211;something the essay questions ask you to do. When we read closely, we avoid generalizing. However, we do need to account for our assumptions. </p>

<p>As an example, here&#8217;s a scene in <em>Mr. Penumbra&#8217;s 24-Hour Bookstore</em> where Kat and Clay are chatting:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“It was amazing,” Kat says. We’re sharing a gluten-free waffle in the Gourmet Grotto and she’s telling me about the inaugural gathering of the new Product Management. She’s wearing a cream-colored blouse with a daggerlike collar; underneath, her T-shirt winks red at her throat.<br/>
 “Totally amazing,” she continues. “Best meeting ever. Completely … structured. You know exactly what’s happening all the time. Everybody brings a laptop—”<br/>
 “Do people even look at one another?”<br/>
“Not really. Everything that matters is on your screen. There’s an agenda that rearranges itself. There’s a back-channel chat. And there’s fact-checking! If you get up to speak, there are people cross-referencing your claims, supporting and refuting you—”<br/>
 It sounds like an engineer’s Athens.<br/>
“—and the meeting is really long, like six hours, but it feels like no time, because you’re thinking so hard. You get totally wrung out. There’s so much information to absorb and it comes so fast. And they—we—make decisions really fast, too. After somebody calls for a vote, it happens live, and you have to cast yours right away, or delegate it to someone else…”<br/>
 Now it sounds more like a reality show. “Now it sounds more like a reality show. This waffle is terrible.
“There’s an engineer named Alex, he’s a big deal, he built most of Google Maps, and I think he likes me—he delegated his vote to me once already, which is pretty crazy, I’m brand-new—”<br/>
I think I’d like to delegate my fist to Alex’s face.<br/>
 “—and there are tons of designers, more designers than usual. Somebody said they tweaked the selection algorithm. I think maybe that’s why I got in, because I’m a designer and a programmer. It’s an optimal combination. Anyway.” She finally takes a breath. (200&#8211;1) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, let&#8217;s extract all the parts where Clay interjects, verbally and mentally, into Kat&#8217;s recounting of her experience: </p>

<ul>
<li>We’re sharing a gluten-free waffle in the Gourmet Grotto and she’s telling me about the inaugural gathering of the new Product Management. She’s wearing a cream-colored blouse with a daggerlike collar; underneath, her T-shirt winks red at her throat.</li>
<li>“Do people even look at one another?”</li>
<li>It sounds like an engineer’s Athens.</li>
<li>Now it sounds more like a reality show. This waffle is terrible.</li>
<li>I think I’d like to delegate my fist to Alex’s face.</li>
<li>She finally takes a breath.</li>
</ul>

<p>Ask yourself: is Clay listening to Kat? How is he interpreting Kat&#8217;s words for us, commenting on her story, giving us his read on what she is saying, how we should receive the story, how we should be listening to what Kat is saying? What&#8217;s interesting is how the above reveals the Point-of-View or &#8220;focalization&#8221; of the narrative is running through Clay&#8217;s interpretation. In other words, it&#8217;s interesting that Clay undercuts Kat&#8217;s enthusiasm with a disdainful commentary that for us readers negates her success. He kind of cuts her down in his asides, minimizes her success, concentrates our attention on superficial characteristics&#8211;her clothes (the red shirt), words such as &#8220;dagger-like,&#8221; he hates her waffle, he&#8217;s jealous, she&#8217;s babbling not breathing. Take a look at Clay&#8217;s commentary&#8230; what of it refers to what she&#8217;s actually saying. In fact, he&#8217;s judgey right of the bat asking, &#8220;Do people even look at one another?&#8221; It encapsulates his disdain for technological situations before he has even learned the lesson at the end of the book&#8211;that sentence is &#8220;future Clay&#8221; speaking, focalizing the narrative through his position in the past and making himself out to be the sage. </p>

<p>Now, on the one hand, I think most of us read Kat as a pretty accomplished woman in the novel. She&#8217;s smart, has a great job, is advancing in that job&#8211;a very competitive space&#8211;and she generally has skills and initiative so far beyond Clay&#8217;s it&#8217;s laughable to compare them. We root for Kat and we admire her as a role model for success. </p>

<p>On the other hand, Kat&#8217;s power is consistently negated in the text. She is constantly undercut (her food is weird, she&#8217;s weird, she&#8217;s too smart), objectified (so much concentration on the red shirt&#8211;do you remember what Clay is wearing? Neel? Penumbra?), and undermined by Clay (she&#8217;s overly optimistic, obsessed by crazy things, ungrounded, not interested in <em>him</em>). Kat is undermined by Clay both through his narrative interjections and in the way he presents her character. He gets us to focus on superficial aspects of Kat&#8217;s character and undermines the exceptional aspects of her character. Kat is at once symbolic of a successful woman and <em>symbolized</em> as a naïve waif who is super-smart, but overly-driven, unenlightened, often tolerated because she is cute. Clay consistently mocks Kat to the reader, pointing to her faults and the foibles of her technological optimism throughout the text, while remaining self-referentially aloof about his own short-comings. Clay&#8217;s shortcomings are endearing where Kat&#8217;s are annoying. Clay&#8217;s shortcomings are depicted as enlightened self-reflection and established stasis where Kat&#8217;s shortcomings are depicted as self-serving optimism and self-centred career advancement negotiated through a red T-shirt.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a few more examples where Kat is represented by Clay in a way that undercuts her empowerment:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s finally time to break a code that has waited five hundred years.<br/>
 Kat has requisitioned Google’s data visualization amphitheater with its massive screens. She’s moved tables from the lunch tent into position down in front; it looks like mission control, picnic-style.<br/>
 The day is beautiful; a sharp blue sky is dotted with wispy white clouds, all commas and curlicues. Hummingbirds hover down to investigate the screens, then zip back out across the bright open lawns. There’s music in the distance; the Google brass band is practicing an algorithmically generated waltz.<br/>
 Down below, Kat’s handpicked code-breaking squad is setting up. Laptops are coming out, each one encrusted with a different collection of colorful stickers and holograms, and the Googlers are plugging into power and fiber optics, flexing their fingers.<br/>
 Igor is among them. His brilliance at the bookstore earned him a special invitation: today, he’s allowed to play in the Big Box. He’s leaning in to his laptop, his skinny hands a bluish blur, and two Googlers are watching wide-eyed over his shoulder.<br/>
 Kat is making the rounds, conferring with Googlers one by one. She smiles and nods and pats them on the back. Today, she’s a general, and these are her troops.” (222&#8211;3) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here, Clay compares Kat to a general, giving her a small leadership role but connecting it metaphorically with Warfare. Not sure Kat would like that comparison. Note too the set up, a kind of garden of eden, all innocence and optimism that will of course come crashing down when Kat ultimately fails. It&#8217;s &#8220;mission control&#8221; but &#8220;picnic-style&#8221; reducing Kat&#8217;s attempts to think differently back to symbolic connections to housewives, kitchens, food preparation, picnics are not work. Again, Clay concentrates on superficialities: stickers, plugging in. He empowers Igor, who has the rapt attention of the Googlers, because he&#8217;s &#8220;brilliant&#8221; where Kat is &#8220;making the rounds.&#8221; Kat&#8217;s a cheerleader where Igor, in a very brief description, is brilliant and popular for his brilliance. </p>

<p>Note how the military metaphor continues as the text moves through the scene:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Kat is grinning. She’s an artillery officer who’s just gotten her hands on a really big gun. Now she looks up at her audience—the fellowship. She cups her hands around her mouth: “That was just the warm-up!”<br/>
There’s a countdown splashed across the screens. Giant rainbow numbers go 5 (red), 4 (green), 3 (blue), 2 (yellow) …
And then, on a sunny Friday morning, for three seconds, you can’t search for anything. You can’t check your email. You can’t watch any videos. You can’t get directions. For just three seconds, nothing works, because every single one of Google’s computers around the world is dedicated to this task.<br/>
Make that a really, really big gun. (227&#8211;8) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>At this point, we have to ask: what&#8217;s with all the guns? Well, guns are often a phallic symbol, so that&#8217;s something. Guns are certainly something that suggests empowerment, but this is a strange sort of empowerment. The Big Box is a metaphoric gun, it cannot actually shoot anything, can&#8217;t fire, can&#8217;t kill. And yet, Clay continually depicts Kat as a military general: a dominating, somewhat shallow individual, who will win at all costs. </p>

<p>At this point, let&#8217;s jump back to an earlier scene in the text where Kat and Clay again meet over food that Clay needs to judge: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>“I don’t see Kat for almost two weeks. She’s busy organizing everything for the Great Decoding, and busy with other Google projects, too. The Product Management is an all-you-can-eat buffet, and she’s hungry. She hasn’t replied to any of my flirty emails, and when she texts me, her messages are two words long.<br/>
 Finally, we meet on Thursday night for a desultory date over sushi. It’s cold, and she’s wearing a heavy houndstooth blazer over a thin gray sweater and a shiny blouse. There’s no sign of her red T-shirt anymore.<br/>
 Kat gushes about Google’s projects, all revealed to her now. They are making a 3-D web browser. They are making a car that drives itself. They are making a sushi search engine—here she pokes a chopstick down at our dinner—to help people find fish that is sustainable and mercury-free. They are building a time machine. They are developing a form of renewable energy that runs on hubris.<br/>
 With each new mega-project she describes, I feel myself shrink smaller and smaller. How can you stay interested in anything—or anyone—for long when the whole world is your canvas?” (209)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this case, the focalization is entirely in Clay&#8217;s mind. He&#8217;s not saying anything out loud. Note how much of this text is about Clay being neglected, not Kat&#8217;s success. He undermines her by making off-hand comments related to food (why food?) He laments the loss of her red t-shirt. He describes her speech as &#8220;gushes,&#8221; snidely refers to &#8220;hubris.&#8221; He&#8217;s so wrapped up in how <em>he</em> feels smaller and smaller that he doesn&#8217;t see that Kat is getting bigger and bigger. </p>

<p>The result of this focalization is that we tend to sympathize with Clay. We feel sorry for him. We react more to his sorrow that we do to Kat&#8217;s success. In so doing, we don&#8217;t yell at Clay for being lazy, for not applying himself, for not doing anything. He&#8217;s no general; he&#8217;s no snappy dresser; he doesn&#8217;t gush. </p> 

<p>When we finally get to the end of the text, when Clay will reveal the code he has broken, we get another depiction of Kat that undermines her and, in a final blow to the validity of her character, allows Clay to get his revenge, his comeuppance for her technological optimism:</p> 

<blockquote>
<p>“Kat is here, sitting up front, way off to the side, talking quietly with Mat and Ashley. She’s wearing her houndstooth blazer again. There’s a green scarf around her neck, and she’s cut her hair since the last time I saw her; now it stops just below her ears.<br/> 
We are no longer dating. There has been no formal declaration, but it’s an objective truth, like the atomic weight of carbon or the share price of GOOG. That didn’t stop me from pestering her and extracting a promise to attend. She, of all people, has to see this.&quot; (269)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Note the pattern again: Clay speaks to Kat&#8217;s clothing, then moves into how she makes <em>him</em> feel. He ends the description by suggesting that &#8220;She, of all people, has to see this.&#8221; Think carefully about the meaning behind this phrase. Is it nice? Why does <em>she of all people</em> have to see it? The implied answer is that she needs to see it because she needs to check herself with all the technological hubris and see that books are really valuable and that technology can&#8217;t solve our problems, good old-fashioned investigative research will solve our problems&#8211;Clay will solve our problems. She needs to be put in her place. </p>

<p>The final depiction of Kat in the novel, runs as follows: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Kat will climb the ranks of the PM. First she’ll bring Google the decoded memoir of Aldus Manutius, which will become the cornerstone of a new Lost Books project. The New York Times will blog about it. Next, the acquisition of Anatomix and the popularity of Google Body will give her even more momentum. She’ll have her picture printed in Wired, a whole glossy half page, standing under the huge data visualization screens, hands on her hips, blazer hanging loosely over her bright red BAM! T-shirt.<br/>
I will realize then that she never stopped wearing it after all.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Note the pattern. She&#8217;s now associated with books and the body&#8211;two things that, as we discussed early on in this course, are often thought-of as female activities&#8211;men are too busy fighting wars and being Generals. And, thankfully for Clay, she never really left the red t-shirt behind to become professional. </p>

<p>Now, based on that close reading of Clay&#8217;s portrayal of Kat, I want to make a few generalizations about what <em>Mr. Penumbra&#8217;s 24-Hour Bookstore</em> means. Clay represents male empowerment and the urge to maintain that empowerment in the face of inevitable change. Kat represents the potential for female empowerment&#8211;the ability to lead and configure change, to find new venues and approaches that will lead to new ways of thinking, new ways of understanding. She&#8217;s a metaphor for changing technology, she&#8217;s mobile, malleable, fast, adaptable, uncomfortable, and optimistic. Clay is a metaphor for established&#8211;one might say entrenched&#8211;technology, unchanging, unmalleable, stuck, certain, slow, safe, comfortable. </p>

<p>What <em>Mr. Penumbra&#8217;s 24-Hour Bookstore</em> represents then, other than the battle between old and knew technologies, old and new knowledge, is the active repression of female empowerment by a male establishment. Kat&#8217;s character is represented in a way that does not allow for her success or even her mobility outside the confines to established or entrenched norms. At every turn the reader is turned toward typical female characterizations: superficialities, irritating ticks, fashion choices, food, gesture. In the end, Kat&#8217;s failure is the impetus for Clay&#8217;s success. Her defeat is his victory.</p>

<hr />

<p>Phew. There&#8217;s your close reading. A few important takeaways:</p>

<ul>
<li>Nest yourself in specific references to the text, in any order, where there are examples to explain and draw from.</li>
<li>Look for patterns, what do these patterns mean, how do they work, what do they emphasize, focus our attention on?</li>
<li>Read for surfaces first, then plunge into the depths (this is very important to remember when reading <em>JPod</em>).</li>
<li>Generalize at the end, after you have presented the specifics.</li>
<li>Make suggestions about what the specifics mean for our assumptions&#8211;ALWAYS ACCOUNT FOR YOUR ASSUMPTIONS</li>
<li>Begin by examining your own assumptions

<ul>
<li>if you are not White, how come you visualize Clay as White? What assumptions are you making about the text?</li>
<li>Why did you predict the ending as you did? What kept you reading?</li>
<li>Which character did you identify with most? Why?</li> 
</ul></li>
<li>Do not generalize!! <em>Mr. Penumbra&#8217;s 24-Hour Bookstore</em> is a text that has particular details that represent digital culture. It does not, in and of itself, represent digital culture.</li>
<li>The text should be used to exemplify places where you assumptions or expectations are met and diverged from. DO NOT EXPLAIN THE TEXT, EXPLAIN HOW OR WHAT IT MEANS TO YOUR ASSUMPTIONS OR EXPECTATIONS.</li>
<li>Avoid, always, explaining the plot, or recounting events. USE the text as evidence not as something that needs to be reviewed in sequence, that&#8217;s not interpreting meaning; that is reviewing meaning.</li>
<li>Book titles need to be in italics. Events in a text take place in the present tense. You write about and reference examples from the text in the present tense. You speak to the textual object itself&#8211;the book / poem / play / stop sign&#8211;in the past tense. I.e.: The play <em>Hamlet</em> <strong>takes place</strong> in Elsinore, Denmark where it <strong>is</strong> set, but the play <strong>was written</strong> in 1603 / Stop signs <strong>have been</strong> around for some time, this is the first I&#8217;ve seen that actually <strong>says</strong> &#8220;Stop&#8221; through a loudspeaker when I approach an intersection.</li>
<li>Unlike what's above, your examples from the text should not be set-off, or in italics. They should be "in quotations and follow the order of your punctuation" (112). Consult an MLA style manual for more. The quotations look the way they do here because of the internet--they're not correctly formatted.</li>
</ul>

<p>As a final bit of levity, below is a nice example of how a close reading of things can get out of hand:</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have posted the following in Modules #5 and #6 to help give some context for writing Essay #1 and help us pivot toward a discussion of themes more broadly. </p>

<ul>
<li>Acheson, Katherine O. "Close Reading: Prose Fiction" and "Aspects of Prose Fiction." <em>Writing Essays About Literature</em> (A Brief Guide For University and College Students) Ontario: Broadview, 2011.</li>
<li>Howe, Elisabeth A. "Inventing Your Argument." <em>Close Reading: An Introduction to Literature.</em> Boston: Longman, 2010.</li>
</ul>

<p>In this lecture, I will be speaking to <em>JPod</em> and some other important interpretive moves. Some of you might want to jump ahead and look at the lecture for Module #6 if you are wanting particular strategies for writing Essay #1. That said, what&#8217;s in here is helpful for writing Essay #1, but on more of a contextual level than what&#8217;s demonstrated in <a href="http://digitalcultureslab.ca/douglascollege-online1102/winter2017/category/lectures/">Lecture #4 or Lecture #6</a></p>

<p>One thing I want to highlight is that the most important facet of your essay should be the correctness of its grammar, syntax, diction (word choice), paragraphing, and argumentative logic. Make sure you are presenting writing that is the very best you can do. If I cannot read the essay or understand its content, I cannot give it a successful grade. Consult the course outline for more information about my expectations. I have no expectations about what might be a &#8220;right&#8221; or &#8220;wrong&#8221; answer to the essay question. However, I do have expectations for the written quality of the essay. Bottom line: if your writing is no good, you essay is no good. Spend some time editing and making sure that your writing is the best it can be before you submit. </p>

<hr />

<p>I asked you to think about themes in the reading for this week&#8217;s module. Here&#8217;s a brief summary to hit the highlights and steer us toward deploying themes in the course. </p>

<p>As the Wikipedia entry notes, themes are what we call the guiding subject in a text. By this I mean that themes are what we identify as the central subjects the text represents, distorts, or projects. I&#8217;ve added the terms represents, distorts, or projects because themes are sometimes present in texts in unusual ways. One of the central themes of <em>Jpod</em> for example is authorship, but I don&#8217;t think the novel is about authorship so much as it comments upon it by distorting the role of the author in a text. As well, the text has numerous authors in it; all the characters write letters, synopses, and commentaries outside the confines of the story events. In short, a theme in <em>JPod</em> is how it <em>represents</em> authorship by <em>distorting</em> how we might understand (or <em>project</em>) the role of authorship. </p>

<p>Most often, themes can be summarized in a single (maybe two), abstract, term(s). The two we&#8217;ve looked at so far for <em>JPod</em> are consumption and now authorship. There are certainly others: friendship, death, working life. What&#8217;s important to understand about themes is that they are <a href="https://www.google.ca/search?q=abstract%3A+define&amp;oq=abstract%3A+define&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i58.5125j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">abstract</a>. We need to use the text to exemplify and explain those abstractions. If I were to ask you to give me an example of &#8220;love,&#8221; each of us would have a different example. That said, we all sort of agree about what love means. In other words, we would know if the example <em>wasn&#8217;t</em> love. This general, often tacit, agreement about what themes mean is what draws us to them in textual analysis. It&#8217;s why we&#8217;ve been speaking a lot about assumptions in the course so far. How we understand themes is through assumptions&#8211;often correct&#8211;about what those abstract terms (love, hate, consumption, authorship) mean. What we&#8217;re looking for, however, is how texts play with our assumptions or offer a different interpretation / representation of the abstract term. Hence our emphasis on close reading of the texts so far&#8211;we need to see how the text <em>exemplifies</em> the theme we think is relevant. </p>

<p>The Wikipedia entry on themes also notes that themes are often binaries&#8211;conflicts. As is often the case, we often need this conflict to be engaged with the text. Simply, <em>Mr. Penumbra&#8217;s 24-Hour Bookstore</em> is a novel about the binaries of old and new, technological and analogue. <em>JPod</em> is a novel about real and fake, contrived and genuine, capitalism and humanity. There&#8217;s lots of themes, both as binaries and key terms. What&#8217;s important for us is the we look at the examples to decipher <em>how</em> these themes are being represented, distorted, and projected, and <em>what</em> that tells us about ourselves, the machinations underlying the text, or the socio-political situations that govern the text&#8217;s production.</p>

<p>Themes are ubiquitous. Every culture has themes, some of them are similar across races, religions, or castes. For instance, anyone can understand a theme such as loss, death, life. These themes are central to human existence. Themes get more complicated when it comes to examples such as power, race, religion, which have different interpretations or points of emphasis. Themes get even more slippery when we merge them or present them as binaries: race and power, religion and death, loss and life. </p>

<p>The short of this is that because themes are abstract, they can be interpreted many ways and represented through many things&#8211;such as novels, poems, stop signs, drama, television, video games, advertisements, furniture, buildings, nationalism, language. You name it, there&#8217;s a theme to it. </p>

<p>The reason we have been learning all the literary terms we have been learning is so that we have some terminology through which to discuss themes. If we are going to speak to the theme of consumption in <em>JPod</em>, we&#8217;ll need to find some examples in the text of Ethan consuming, or textual examples of food, or textual examples of sickness (&#8220;consumption&#8221; used to mean tuberculous). We find these examples in order to make a claim about, and this is the important point, how the text defines a particularly theme (or binary). </p>

<ul>
<li>How does <em>JPod</em> define consumption?</li>
<li>How does <em>JPod</em> define death?</li>
<li>How does <em>JPod</em> define friendship?</li>
<li>How does <em>JPod</em> define authorship?</li>
<li>How does <em>JPod</em> distort the assumed binary between character and author in order to define storytelling?</li>
<li>How does <em>JPod</em> distort the assumed binary between literature and advertising in order to define the experience of popular culture?</li>
<li>How does <em>JPod</em> project a representation of Vancouver that is understood differently by those who actually live in Vancouver in order to define the experience of an evolving metropolis?</li>
<li>How does <em>JPod</em> project as representation of working life that is at odds with our assumptions of success in order to define the hopelessness of technological optimism?</li>
</ul>

<p>See how complicated we can get? The big takeaway here is that if we look in the text of <em>JPod</em> we can find examples, patterns of examples, characters, POVs, settings, metaphors, symbols, that will help us define how the text defines&#8211;and that is the work of critical analysis. </p>

<hr />

<p>A few brief definitions in order to set up some ways of interpreting <em>JPod</em>:</p>

<p>1) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intertextuality">Intertextuality</a> or Allusion - the relationship between texts. Note that intertextuality can be intentional or accidental. As we move through the course, we&#8217;ll want to be conscious of how the texts in this course might function as intertextual references. One way we&#8217;ve used intertextuality already in the course is to compare <em>Mr. Penumbra&#8217;s 24-Hour bookstore</em> to texts such as <em>Harry Potter</em> or <em>Lord of the Rings</em> or even <em>Seinfeld</em> all of which feature a group of people on the search for something, be it treasure, peace, or the correct mannerisms of certain situations (<em>Seinfeld</em> is obsessed with public mannerism and appropriate behaviour, something also present in <em>JPod</em>).</p>

<p>Point is, we always need to think about how other texts influence our reception of the text we are reading. That can mean other books we have read, what we know about grocery stores, or even our socio-cultural background and the stories we heard as children. Understanding themes means being accountable to the role of intertextuality in shaping our expectations&#8211;often so that those expectations can be subverted, but that&#8217;s another lecture. </p>

<p>2) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_capital">Cultural Capital</a> - the currency you possess that makes it easier to understand things such as allusion or intertextuality. We&#8217;ll deal more fully with cultural capital later, but I want to introduce it now as a concept central to <em>Jpod</em>. What we know about advertising and the world of startup culture will influence how we receive <em>JPod</em>. If you live in Vancouver, you have more cultural capital (or currency) for visualizing the setting of the text (EA Games in Burnaby for instance is the obvious one). </p>

<p>Point is, we should always be aware not only of our own cultural capital, but how cultural capital is exchanged in the text between characters or between reader and author. These spaces often nest assumptions about power, race, sexism, gender; the deeply-seeded assumptions that are the bedrock for our assumptions about themes. </p>

<hr />

<p>As a last little bit, I&#8217;ll leave you with this video of a Tesla driving itself. </p>

<center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V4PDTD2VHSU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>

<p>Take note of how the video represents the action of the Tesla driving itself: the music, the speed, the &#8220;terminator-like&#8221; computer interfaces / cameras. (You can slow down the video by adjusting the playback speed in the lower right-hand corner.)</p>

<p>Think about the following: </p>

<ul>
<li>How does it make incredible technological advances look mundane? (<em>JPod</em> makes high-paying, highly-skilled technology jobs look boring and unchallenging.)</li>
<li>How does it make the car the focus (with its human characteristics) while also representing the absence of a human needed to drive the car? (<em>JPod</em> makes humans into a resistance against the machinery of popular culture - irony is a defence-mechanism. How does this Tesla video undercut humanity by making humanity&#8217;s absence ironic?)</li>
<li>When you slow the video down, is it still exciting? (<em>JPod</em> interrupts our reading constantly, drawing attention to our reading, which is annoying, but its a great parallel for how we experience the world. Think about how texts from friends interrupt your workflow, or the multifarious presentation of Facebook&#8217;s timeline, or commercial breaks on TV and YouTube.)</li>
</ul>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some Writing Tips for English 1102:
Essays for English Literature</p>

<p><strong>Some Rules for Approach:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Work from the text, outward. Start with a specific example from the text and work toward explaining how that example means something.</li>
<li>Avoid big contextual statements at the beginning about meaning and / or representation&#8211;nothing about &#8220;technology&#8221; or &#8220;daily life&#8221; or &#8220;today&#8217;s world&#8221; or &#8220;fast-paced&#8221; or &#8220;subliminal meanings&#8221;&#8211;concentrate on the text and the patterns that make meaning as illustrated through the text, then move to broad claims.</li>
<li>You are trying to show that you can <em>use</em> the text as an example to make a claim (or &#8220;reading&#8221;) about what the novel means, or comments upon. Be careful that you do not write a book review; I am assuming you read the book. You are not responsible for showing me that you read the book, or that you understood it. You <em>are</em> responsible for using the text to make a claim for how we might read it: what assumptions are confirmed or debunked, what do symbols mean, how do characters interact, what is the effect of the setting on atmosphere or mood or characters?</li>
<li>Your paragraphs&#8211;or segments (because sometimes you need more than one paragraph to pull things off appropriately)&#8211;should be &#8220;top-heavy.&#8221;

<ul>
<li>Begin with a topic sentence that introduces the subject for discussion (a symbol, item, place, person&#8211;a <strong>thing</strong>)</li>
<li>Introduce evidence from the text (quotation here, direct evidence, not too long), then contextualize it a bit: how will you be speaking to this piece of evidence?</li>
<li>Analyze the evidence: what does your evidence illustrate? How does it do that? Why does it do that? What is the significance of that?</li>
<li>Transition into the next segment: remind the reader what your interpretation is in your thesis and how the evidence supports that reading, then move to the next item.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>I am not the audience for your essay. The audience for your essay is a person who has read the book and wants to know what you think it means. Avoid writing for my expectations, write about what you think is interesting about the text&#8217;s meaning, interpretation, potential statements.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p><strong>Get the Basics Correct:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>Make sure you have the character’s names correct, the novel title, etc.</li>
<li>No unnecessary information. Your audience has read the book, knows the story and the plot. Do not spend time recounting these things unless they are relevant to your textual example.</li>
<li>References to the events inside the novel use the present tense: &#8220;Douglas Coupland <em>appears</em> in the text.&#8221; / &#8220;Kat <em>is</em> a woman who <em>wants</em> to get ahead.&#8221;</li>
<li>Locate your essay in things, examples, and explanations about their meaning rather than pointing to potentials (words such as “aspects,” “issues,” “parts” all suggest things that are missing–<em>NAME!!! the specific “aspects” or “issues” or “parts”! What are they, specifically? You need to reference objects, people, items.</em></li>
<li>Make sure the formatting is correct. The essay should follow MLA formatting (google it, or <a href="https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/747/01/">follow this link</a></li>
<li>Titles of novels get <em>italicized</em> and always use double quotation marks, not single: &#8220;like this&#8221; not &#8216;like this.&#8217;</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p><strong>A Kinda Walkthrough:</strong></p>

<p>The best way to approach essay #1 is to foreground your scene. As I modelled in the last lecture, you&#8217;ll want to work through the details of your scene or scenes. You&#8217;re looking for patterns, or peculiarities in how the text represents something. To do this, you might need to alter the sequence of the scenes&#8211;don&#8217;t just follow the linear progression of the novel. If you have two examples, one from the beginning of the novel and one from the end, feel free to put the example from the end first in your essay if that&#8217;s what works. <strong>Always use the evidence so that your point is strong</strong>; this means you might present evidence in a different sequence than it appears in the text&#8211;that&#8217;s fine. </p>

<p>For the sake of an example, I will walk through a close reading of the scene below, taken from <em>Mr. Penumbra&#8217;s 24-Hour Bookstore</em> (123). Remember, what I am doing here isn&#8217;t really an essay example, and it&#8217;s not meant to be prescriptive. Instead, think of the walkthroughs here are scaffolding for how you <em>might</em> approach the essay yourself. Make sure you take a careful look at the &#8220;Close Reading - Prose Fiction&#8221; reading in Module #5 to get a more &#8220;textbook&#8221; sense of what&#8217;s being asked of you for Essay #1. </p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the selection from <em>Mr. Penumbra&#8217;s 24-Hour Bookstore</em> (123): </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Now: I’m dealing with too much information here. I only want to see who borrowed what. Kat’s analysis was smart enough to tag names and titles and times in the text, and the visualization knows how to plot those, so I link the data to display and I see something familiar: a swarm of colored lights bouncing through the shelves, each one representing a customer. These, though, are customers from years ago.
 It doesn’t look like much—just a colorful mess migrating through the Waybacklist. Then, on a hunch, I connect the dots, so it’s not a swarm but a set of constellations. Every customer leaves a trail, a drunken zigzag through the shelves. The shortest constellation, rendered in red clay, makes a tiny Z, just four data points. The longest, in a dark moss, curves around the whole width of the store in a long jagged oval.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here&#8217;s how I might go about coming up with a thesis statement about what this scene means. I&#8217;m doing a series of revisions because you should expect to do so as well. Your argument won&#8217;t be clear right away: </p>

<p>First go: Mr. Penumbra’s 24-Hour Bookstore suggests that making sense of information overload is as simple as rendering real-world data through computer visualization.</p>

<p>Second revision: Mr. Penumbra’s 24-Hour Bookstore represents making sense of information in an old-world way, understanding information through computer visualization.</p>

<p>Third revision: Old-world knowledge continually creeps into Mr. Penumbra’s 24-Hour Bookstore and its representations of technological solutions.</p>

<p>Notice how I have moved the subject of my analysis (old-world knowledge) to the front of my sentence. While I will be using the text of the novel to provide an example, the essay is really about how old-world knowledge is represented in the novel. Where words, actions, symbols, settings, etc., of old-world knowledge infiltrate the technological emphasis.</p>

<p>Now, a few examples of how we would use the text to support the above claim, note how I parse out the scene above, integrating it into my paragraph. The block-quote above is just for me, in my rough work. Below is how you should integrate it more formally in the essay:</p>

<p>When Clay notes [present tense!] that “Kat’s analysis was smart enough to tag names and titles and times in the text, and the visualization knows how to plot those” (123), he suggests that the power of vision is central to understanding information, not just the computer’s crunching of numbers. The presence of “tags,” “titles,” “times” in the text suggest that the information needed to understand “too much information” (123) must be geared toward the sensory world of the human being. Computers alone cannot help us understand patterns or histories, Clay needs to “see something familiar: a swarm of colored lights” (123) that will guide his analysis. That guided analysis, not the his computer savvy, or even Kat’s access to all the computer savvy in the world, will be what helps Clay decipher the mythologies of the past that dominant the narrative of <em>Mr. Penumbra’s 24-Hour Bookstore</em>.</p>

<p>Now, if you look at that last sentence, it reads like a little better thesis than the one we have up top. So, we edit again: </p>

<p>Fourth revision: Old-world, sensory knowledge and interactions with the real world continually creep into Mr. Penumbra’s 24-Hour Bookstore colliding with mythologies of technological solutions.</p>

<p>OR</p>

<p>Fifth revision: Knowledge acquired through human senses, not through computer interactions or technological solutions, help Clay decipher the mythologies of the past that dominant the narrative of Mr. Penumbra’s 24-Hour Bookstore.</p>

<p>From here, we could go back and forth with the quoted text above, and then move outward to make a claim about the “mythologies of the past” that the book harbours.</p>

<p>Point is, we move back and forth between the quote, using THE ACTUAL WORDS IN THE QUOTE, to develop and progress through a reading of the novel’s meaning.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>A Few Other Things to Avoid: Some Examples:</strong></p>

<p>If you were to write something such as: “The use of POV here helps to further develop the theme that we shouldn’t rely on technology as much as we do now.”</p>

<p>I would suggest that you:</p>

<ul>
<li>Do not make references to the outside or “real world”; we need to focus on what the text means</li>
<li>Write out “point-of-view”; no short-forms</li>
<li>If you drop a term such as “theme,” you better be clear about what that is and it better refer to the novel in question</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>If you were to write something such as: “Kat Potente is a female character in the novel. The main characteristics of Kat were she is an attractive girl. Clay had a crush on her.”</p>

<p>I would say / ask:</p>

<ul>
<li>This is all pointless information. Anyone who has read the book would know this stuff. instead, talk about what she represents</li>
<li>What does it mean that she is attractive, what does that signal?</li>
<li>What does Clay’s attraction to Kat do to him? How does it affect him?</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>If you were to write something such as: “In the novel, JPod, written by Douglas Coupland, Ethan is a main character with aspects of symbolism.”</p>

<p>I would note and ask: </p>

<ul>
<li>This sentence is horrible for an essay. We know it’s a novel, we know it was written by Coupland, we know Ethan is a character.</li>
<li>What are the “aspects of symbolism”? Name them.</li>
<li>Sentence should read something like: “Ethan represents the affects of consumerism and how it affects an individual’s ability to understand his/her reality.”</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>If you were to write something such as: “Neel Shah is an Indian character that demonstrates the diversity and different point of view where inserted into the story.”</p>

<p>I would tell you to: </p>

<ul>
<li>Show me, using a specific textual example, where the novel actually states Neel is “Indian”</li>
<li>Show me, using specific textual examples, the diversity he demonstrates</li>
<li>Show me, using specific textual examples, the different point of view Nell offers</li>
<li>Show me, using specific textual examples, where is changes the story</li>
<li>The bottom line here is to focus on what’s in the quotation you choose and how that material suggests a larger meaning, or provides an example for some larger meaning, in the novel. You must locate your analysis in the textual examples. If you don’t, you will struggle to generate word count and you will tend to generalize wildly rather than make a reasonable claim based on sound interpretation.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Alright kids. Good Luck!! You can do this!!</strong></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>English 1102 (Online) Activity Prompt #5 - Week 5<br/>
Complete by Feb. 8th<br/>
Winter 2017 - Douglas College - David N. Wright</strong> </p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Outcomes Statement:</strong> This activity prompt is designed to get you thinking about how <em>JPod</em> uses intertextuality to introduce and describe situations, characters, or interactions.</p>

<p><strong>Task:</strong></p>

<p>Sometime before February 8th, write up a letter to your favourite (I use this term loosely) popular culture food icon. The icon <strong>can&#8217;t</strong> be Ronald McDonald, but it could be Wendy, The Burger King, The Pillsbury Doughboy, Captain Crunch, An endless number of Rabbits, Snap, Crackle, or Pop (or all three), Aunt Jemima, Uncle Ben among other racist icons, and so on. </p>

<p>You should use &#8220;Douglas Coupland&#8217;s&#8221; (in quotes because I am speaking about the character, not the author) letter to Ethan on page 300 of <em>JPod</em>, beginning &#8220;Ethan, thanks for telling me about your life and everything. It&#8217;s intriguing&#8230;&#8221; as a model. Write a letter to your favourite food icon that tries to make a judgement upon his/her character (nothing too cruel, and really think about what you are saying). </p>

<p>Some things to think about:</p>

<ol>
<li>What&#8217;s the tone you are taking?</li>
<li>How do you visualize you food icon? What basis to you have for her humanity?</li>
<li>How do your expectations for the food the icon represents influence how you chose the icon and the content of your letter to her?</li>
<li>What examples do you refer to in your letter? Why those examples? How are they representative of the food the icon represents?</li>
<li><em>How</em> does the icon appeal to you? Speak to some characteristics that the icon possesses and explain what you find valuable or off-putting about them. Why are you intrigued by the icon? Why are you connected to the icon?</li>
<li>How does <em>JPod</em> work to exploit our knowledge of popular culture icons to create meaning?</li>
</ol>

<hr />

<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>

<p>The above activity is trying to demystify the act of interpretation. If we stick with trying to understand <em>what</em> we are experiencing in <em>JPod</em> rather than the <em>why</em> we are experiencing it, the text has some interesting things to say about the nature of consumption, authorship, consumerism, and popular culture (all themes!). We don&#8217;t have to read texts looking for reasons why they were written, or authorial motivations. Most of the time, we need to read them to see how they represent the experience of living&#8211;whether we have lived that way of not. Again, it&#8217;s all about what you visualize and how you visualize&#8211;or imagine&#8211;the text in your head. Try to think about how that image in your head comes to be and what it might mean. If you&#8217;re confused, what is it that&#8217;s making you confused in the text? When are you not confused? Then, examine the differences to get at what the text is trying to represent (it might be confusion!). If you took all the scenes in <em>JPod</em> where characters are writing letters, what could you say about how the text &#8220;makes meaning&#8221; and comments on the nature of representation, the role of figures (icons) who represent things to / for us, and our interaction with them or communication more generally between ourselves?</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With this lecture, we&#8217;re heading into a period of heavy assessment and, as a result, turning our attention toward the direct application of thematic analysis in the course. As you read the below, please keep in mind that we&#8217;ve pivoted and that you should focus on a close reading for Essay #1 and not suddenly turn to a thematic analysis because we&#8217;ve moved on to themes. Stick with what the prompt for Essay #1 is asking for and make sure you are meeting those outcomes. </p>

<p>First up, a few qualifiers:</p>

<ol>
<li>Essays are due by Email on Wednesday Feb. 15, 2017. Anytime before 11:59pm by Email date-stamp counts as on time.</li>
<li>As far as essays are concerned, please make sure you are aware of the formal requirements. Namely: have a title, MLA citation style in-text and work cited, correct capitalization and emphasis. Review the lecture on essay tips for more about this and get google about what you don&#8217;t know.</li>
<li>I will post a preview of the mid-term exam next week (probably after the essay due date so you concentrate on one thing at a time). The exam will cover <strong>everything</strong> up to, and including the week ending Feb. 17. Both <em>JPod</em> and <em>Mr. Penumbra&#8217;s 24-Hour Bookstore</em>, all the readings around literary terminology, and the more recent stuff around themes, intertextuality, allusion, and cultural capital. If a reading (novel, essay, wikipedia definition, chapter, video, slideshow) appears on the schedule or in the class lectures, it is in play. The exam will not directly address the Reading Response Blogs or the Activity Prompts.</li>
<li>Studying for the exam is best approached by working to understand the interrelationships between the definitions of key literary terms, their deployment and exemplification in the novels, and of course the significance and shape of the novels themselves. Most often, you will need to apply the concepts of the course to perform textual analysis or contextualize a definition. Rather than memorizing specifics, pay attention to how we have used, illustrated, or defined the texts in the course so far.</li>
</ol>

<p>With all that said, we are now pivoting toward thematic analysis, as I note above. We are now turning our attention to understanding how themes are represented in the literature we have encountered, and will encounter, in the course. To this end, we will be building off our knowledge of key literary terms and close reading to apply those literary terms and strategies for close reading to interpreting how texts represent themes. </p>

<p><strong>What is a theme?</strong></p>

<p>Themes, generally, have some consistent definitional components. Below, I cover off the important ones, but others will emerge as we encounter different representational approaches and as we bring in our own cultural perspectives to bear on the literary texts. </p>

<ol>
<li>Themes tend to transgresses texts and boundaries. Themes, unlike most symbols and metaphors, are not linked irrevocably to the text in which it is represented. A theme such as &#8220;loneliness&#8221; will be the focus of many different texts, whereas the symbol for loneliness, say that of a leaf, falling isolated and alone, from a tree, will appear only in a poem by E. E. Cummings. Point is, as I note in last week&#8217;s lecture, themes are abstract concepts where symbolic meaning is wrapped up in specific things (a leaf, as per the example above).</li>
<li>Themes tend to represent some common cultural belief, or set of beliefs. Themes, even as abstract concepts, are commonly understood. We all understand what love is, no matter what culture we come from, but how we choose to represent love is different. Helping us understand the differences in our representations of love is, some would argue, the central function of literature and literary interpretation. Themes then help us categorize our thinking so that we recognize patterns, sequences, and similarities in representations. Along these lines, you might ask: why do we often represent the concept of love through flowers, lips, and hearts?</li>
<li>Themes tend to be embodied or represented in a symbol (fixed to the text as above), but one that has universally recognized traits. For example, take the theme of detection. Our primary representation of detection is the detective, but let&#8217;s look at some differences between how male and female detectives are represented (how you visualize the detective based on the description):
 - Male detectives tend to be strong, violent, street smart, a loner. They tend to have chiseled features and are more cunning than the criminals they are searching for and others are afraid of the potential harm that might come to them if they double-cross these male detectives (they are intimidating). Some examples might be Sherlock Holmes, Bulldog Drummond, Thomas Magnum, Philip Marlowe, Adrian Monk, Hercule Poirot, and Sam Spade&#8211;note how the names actually <em>represent</em> the characteristics above, we&#8217;re all magnums, spades, bulldogs, Hercules.
 - Female detectives tend to be smart, tender, connected to a unique set of friends. They tend to use there sexuality to their advantage (as distraction or allure) and rely on others under-estimating their abilities rather than being afraid of their abilities (they&#8217;re not at all intimidating). Some examples might be Nancy Drew, Miss Marple, Precious Ramotswe, Veronica Mars, Lis Salander, Jessica Fletcher, Temperance Brennan, Marge Gunderson, and Sabrina Duncan, Jill Munroe, and Kelly Garrett (Charlie&#8217;s Angels). Note how few of these women you&#8217;ve heard of and, now the names are quite different sounding, even &#8220;temperate.&#8221;
 - The point here is that the theme of detection is universally understood as, basically, how someone goes above finding something out. However, how that theme is represented through character is quite different depending on the gender one chooses to look at. If we go even deeper, we might look at the unique traits of Lis Salander to see how she challenges our assumptions around the traditional representations of a detective. Or, we might look at Sherlock Holmes as a way of understanding the historical underpinning of the detective character. Or, still, we might look at how Benedict Cumberbatch reacquainted us with the traditional mode of detection after the destabilizing rupture of Lis Salander. Any <em>one</em> of these approaches might work for an undergraduate-level essay.
 - In any event, we are looking at patterns of representation. How do examples from the text add up to tell us something about how something is represented to us&#8211;how we visualize that object, character, setting, or POV? Then, we&#8217;re focusing on the patterns, sequences, and similarities / differences in representation and making a claim about what those things might mean to our understanding of&#8211;or expectations for&#8211;the theme more generally.</li>
<li>Themes tend to be connected to some moral element of human understanding. We use themes to help us understand the fundamentals of human behaviour. Themes of &#8220;goodness&#8221; help us understand what it mean sto be good (and, by the absence of it, bad). In short, themes are a way of passing on information&#8211;usually moral&#8211;about how to behave properly and live life in a particular&#8211;usually proper&#8211;way.</li>
<li>Themes tend to be a very abstract term, one that needs to be defined through specifics (literary terms) and the things those specifics might represent. So, a theme of &#8220;love&#8221; is very abstract. We need examples from texts to help us understand what it really means&#8211;and there are hundreds of different meanings. In every case, we are using texts to exemplify the specific characteristics of a theme. So, there might be a pattern of symbols, language, or objects that suggest a theme and then, expanding beyond that, there might be a pattern of representations that help us understand a theme in a culture, epoch, or temporal period.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Themes Can Be:</strong></p>

<p>Often, we take themes and then smash them together to create binaries. For instance, we can use literary terms and smash them against themes to think about the relationship between symbolic representation and the definition of a theme. </p>

<p>There are big themes, such as Power, Tradition, Coming of Age, The Meaning of Life, Communication, Mortality, Race, Love, Sex, Identity, Cultural Differences, Nature, Morality, Religion, Social Justice, and History, to name but a few. We can take these big themes and could them with a literary term (character, setting, symbol, metaphor, atmosphere, etc., represented below as &#8220;X&#8221;) to see how the literary subject represents the theme: X vs. Society; X vs. Power; X vs Tradition, X vs Nature; X vs X; X as representation of Social Justice and so on. </p>

<p>We can also think about the more specific sub-sets of the big themes such as Consumption, Chaos, Capitalism, Companionship, Disillusionment, Displacement, Family, Heroism, Injustice, Isolation, Knowledge, Loneliness, Motherhood, Nationalism, Oppression, Role of the Individual, Selfhood, Social Mobility, Technology, Vanity, and War. We can smash these against literary subjects or indeed against each other. How do representations of consumption lead to chaos in <em>JPod</em> for instance? How might the representation of knowledge lead to a particular representation of family makeup in <em>Mr. Penumbra&#8217;s 24-Hour Bookstore</em>? </p>

<p>In each instance, we are using the text to exemplify (provide us with examples of) the patterns of representation that help us define a particular theme, which is why close reading is so important&#8211;we need examples, real things from the text. </p>

<p>We can also be even more specific about themes, getting into sub-sets or the sub-sets. Themes such as: Arrogance, Art, Belief, Bravery, Children, Common sense, Conservation, Conspiracy, Corruption, Courage, Death, Democracy, Desire, Despair, Failure, Family, Fate, Feminism, Freedom, Friendship, Happiness, Hate, Heritage, Identity, Ideology, Ignorance, Innocence, Isolation, Jealousy, Justice, Kindness, Loyalty, Passion, Patriotism, Peer Pressure, Prejudice, Pride, Quests, Revolution, Revenge, Survival, Time, Vice, Violence. </p>

<p>Finally, we can get specific about the sub-sets of the sub-sets of the sub-sets, often implying a connection between literary device and the theme itself: Adversity, Aging, Change, Childhood, Courage, Deception, Faith, Fame, Grief, Hope, Imagination, Memory, Music, Pain, Patience, Trust, Work.</p>

<p>Again, in each instance, we are using the text to exemplify (provide us with examples of) the patterns of representation that help us define a particular theme, which is why close reading is so important&#8211;we need examples, real things from the text. We are looking at patterns, sequences, and similarities of things from the text to discover how those patterns, sequences, and similarities from the text might be used to define a theme, suggest a unique understanding of a theme, or challenge our assumptions about the &#8220;general concept&#8221; for a theme. </p>

<p><strong>What&#8217;s Important:</strong></p>

<p>The main thrust of literary study&#8211;and textual criticism in general (but not for essay #1)&#8211;is to connect literary terminology, exemplified in the text at hand, to the representation of a theme. </p>

<p>The main purpose for understanding interpretive concepts such as allusion / intertextuality and cultural capital is to provide context for understanding themes and recognizing how patterns of representation shape a cultural situation or interpret themes for us. For instance,
 - a consistent pattern of under-representation is problematic for our understanding of self-hood (How do women understand selfhood if men are always writing female characters? How do we understand race if only White people are writing about race?).
 - a consistent pattern of representing nationalism tells us who we are as a cultural group (think about how Tim Horton&#8217;s &#8220;represents&#8221; Canada in its commercials&#8211;think about the <em>pattern</em>, usually hockey, snow, driving, cottage-life, etc., and how those things represent Canadian Nationalism).
 - a consistent pattern of representation (as a criminal, for instance) tells us our bias or flawed assumptions about our cultural ideologies
 - a consistent pattern of perspective (from the male POV only) tells us <em>how</em> that view might be subjective or one-dimensional (see above and the objectification of women or racial profiling).
 - a consistent pattern of representation around a single theme (friendship, for instance) tells us how &#8220;friendship&#8221; might look so we know when we have a friend (as accepted by the social construct of friendship&#8211;represented as a theme).
On and on this goes until we&#8217;re sick to death of talking about it, but closer to understanding the fluidity of a theme such as friendship or the underlying assumptions of representations of racial minorities or women or, if you like, men who cry. </p>

<p>As a way of contextualizing this more broadly, you might think about the larger themes that organize your program of study; what themes are present in what you are studying:
 - Nursing - patient care, knowledgeable practice, death, dying, sickness, heath, inspiration, hard work
 - Therapeutic Recreation - physical activity, creative thinking, leisure, guidance
 - Psychology - individuals, mental health, power dynamics, motivation, attitude, social dynamics
Certainly, there are other aspects to what you love about life that are organized around themes. There&#8217;s holidays (Halloween is organized around themes, as is Valentine&#8217;s Day). Try to think about the underlying representational assumption of those themes and how texts support, resist, or distort those assumptions. </p>

<hr />

<p>Below is an episode of the CBC series version of <em>JPod</em>. Feel free to watch the whole thing, but you don&#8217;t have to&#8211;just watch the first two minutes, to the credits; it won&#8217;t be on the exam!</p>

<center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0RQLtTKc-M0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>

<p>Take note of your assumptions: is this how you pictured Ethan? The JPod itself? Cowboy? </p>

<p>Then, note that in difference to the novel, the TV version seems to be foreground a search for love as a central theme&#8211;capitalizing upon the suspense (see Sam and Diane on <em>Cheers</em>, or Ross and Racheal on <em>Friends</em> or Leonard and Penny on <em>The Big Bang Theory</em>&#8211;see what I just did there? PATTERNS). The TV version also focuses on the irony of how the JPodders do not take their work seriously, despite it being a place of work. Finally, note how the opening credits focus our attention on some of the thematic concerns of the show, foreshadowing what we should be looking for&#8211;drugs, computers, numbers, etc.</p>

<p>In short, the TV representation of <em>JPod</em> is someone else&#8217;s interpretation of the novel&#8217;s central themes. Someone has read the book and thought, &#8220;alright, how do I make this into a TV show that emphasizes a few themes that people will be interested in?&#8221;</p>

<p>Thinking about what the TV Show leaves out, leaves in, or emphasizes, will tell you a lot about how themes appear in texts. That said, do not forget: themes help us categorize our thinking so that we recognize patterns, sequences, and similarities in representations in a text. We <strong>must use</strong> the text to exemplify the characteristics of a theme before we can make a claim about how the text represents a theme. So, Bree&#8217;s letters in <em>JPod</em> can represent the theme of sexual empowerment, not <em>JPod</em> has aspects that represent sexual empowerment. You need to explain how examples taken from Bree&#8217;s letters in the text suggest characteristics of sexual empowerment; you&#8217;re not allowed to simply speak to sexual empowerment in the novel&#8211;<strong>you need to include specific details and examples from the text that prove the theme is present</strong>. </p>

<p>Alright, chew on this for awhile and we&#8217;ll pick up on this thread next week!</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lecture Module #7 - Poetry</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a short lecture this week. Make sure you review the course modules for all the previous weeks of the course in preparation for the exam (more on that a little later). </p>

<p>The readings you are responsible for in this module are below. They are also on the course schedule and <strong>will not</strong> be required for the mid-term exam. </p>

<ul>
<li>Read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poetry">Poetry</a>, focusing on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poetry#Form_in_poetry">poetic form</a> and definitions for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrative_poetry">Narrative Poetry</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_poetry">Epic Poetry</a>

<ul>
<li>You should be able to identify the characteristics that define the above</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Read William Gibson&#8217;s long poem <a href="http://www.williamgibsonbooks.com/source/agrippa.asp"><em>Agrippa</em></a> and the <a href="http://agrippa.english.ucsb.edu/category/the-book-subcategories/the-poem">accompanying context pages</a>

<ul>
<li>(Please read the above materials carefully. Understanding the context behind this poem is crucial for understanding the content)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Read and <a href="http://www.continentcontinent.cc/index.php/continent/article/view/97">download this .pdf from Ishac Bertram</a> that gives a few examples of &#8220;code poems&#8221;</li>
<li>Read Elizabeth Bishop&#8217;s poem <a href="http://allpoetry.com/poem/8493577-Sestina-by-Elizabeth-Bishop">&#8220;Sestina&#8221;</a></li>
<li>Read E. E. Cummings&#8217; poems <a href="http://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poem/r-p-o-p-h-e-s-s-g-r">&#8220;r-p-o-p-h-e-s-s-g-r&#8221;</a> and <a href="http://poetry-fromthehart.blogspot.ca/2011/06/ee-cummings-la.html">&#8220;1(a&#8221;</a></li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>We&#8217;ll get to the key details in next week&#8217;s module, but I want to emphasize and few themes you might want to explore in the above selections. One theme of interest is form. In poetry, form generally means the patterns that a poem uses to create effect or how the poem uses patterns to create effect. Poems are highly visual and they &#8220;compress&#8221; language, forcing a lot of meaning into a very tight space. In <em>Agrippa</em> for instance, the speaker in the poem is going through a photo album reflecting on the &#8220;mechanisms&#8221; that go into its construction (of the poem, of the photos and of memory). &#8220;r-p-o-p-h-e-s-s-g-r&#8221; on the other hand uses form as a way to visually represent a grasshopper&#8217;s movement through the grass and the act of assembly that goes on as we read through the poem itself (from confusion to resolution to image). I want you to be very attuned to how these poems look, how they compact different meanings into language, and how they use form to help us visualize an imaginary (or real) space. </p>

<p>To this end, think about how the poems build off the form of <em>JPod</em> and think about how <em>JPod</em> itself might rely on the conventions common to poetry. How might reading <em>JPod</em> poetically influence how we understand that novel? And, think carefully about how you visualize the activity of the poem. What are you visualizing? How does the form of the poem help you do that? (You might need to refresh your memory about stanzas, line breaks, and poetic conventions too!)</p>

<p><strong>Behind the Mask: Understanding Persona</strong></p>

<p>One of the most common devices used in poetry is that of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persona">persona</a>. Briefly, what we&#8217;re looking at here is the way writers, or characters, hide behind masks. We want to think about how persona offers us a way to interrogate the role of the speaker without having to account for the motivations of authorship. It&#8217;s an important concept that we&#8217;ll be applying later. Make sure you understand what persona is and how it functions as a literary tool&#8211;you might think about how persona works with elements of criticism we have already encountered, such as character, setting, symbol, metaphor, intertextuality, and even cultural capital.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Stuart Hall</strong></p>

<p>You were asked to read an explanation of Stuart Hall&#8217;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encoding/decoding_model_of_communication">&#8220;Encoding and Decoding&#8221;</a> essay. I&#8217;m going to speak more to the relevance of Hall&#8217;s work in our next lecture, but for now read this to see how Hall&#8217;s approach offers us a way of understanding and making &#8220;problematic&#8221; the act of reading. Often, we just assume what we are reading is what we are reading. We take at face value what we receive from a text. What Hall is trying to illustrate is that this &#8220;letting the meaning wash over us&#8221; is too simplistic. We bring to reading all our own biases, desires, and meanings. And, that we read in a directed way&#8211;we seek to confirm meaning, to understand things in our context, rather than to interpret meaning. </p>

<p>To briefly break Hall&#8217;s ideas down, there are three kinds of readers:
 - Dominant
 - Negotiated
 - Oppositional</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>The dominant</strong> reader decodes the text exactly as was intended.

<ul>
<li>The dominant reading of a text is what most people would understand it to be about. The dominant reading tends to be surface, not inclusive of the other possible, or deeper, meanings.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The negotiating</strong> reader decodes the texts by negotiating between the dominant reading and one that suits his / her own interests or aims.

<ul>
<li>We frequently read texts this way; we believe most of what a character talks about, but something about how they say it for instance makes us suspicious of his/her motivations.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The oppositional</strong> reader can decode the dominant message, but chooses to reject that meaning because it doesn&#8217;t really apply to his/her social, economic or cultural situation.

<ul>
<li>Also known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resistant_reading" target="_blank">resistant reading</a>, the oppositional approach does things like question the representation of gender or sexuality and challenges the cultural assumptions represented in the text.</li>
<li>We might apply an oppositional reading to a TV show like the <em>Brady Bunch</em> that idealizes a family dynamic, but at the same time seems to condone divorce.</li>
<li>We might also perform an oppositional reading if we are not inclined toward heterosexuality&#8211;two cowboys in the isolation of the desert playing with each others guns or two women caressing each other&#8217;s underwear in an advertisement might have entirely different possible readings than the intended literal meaning (if you&#8217;re giggling right now over the last two examples, you&#8217;re doing oppositional reading).</li>
<li>Oppositional reading then still decodes the literal meaning, but it rejects it in favour of another perspective based on a different cultural, economic, or social viewpoint.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>As I note above, we&#8217;ll pick up on this in the next module. For now, make sure you have a handle on the three types of reading and the approach that marks each. </p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a great little video of Hall talking about his approaches: </p>

		<title>The Mid-Term Exam!!</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>There&#8217;s some very important technical notes about completing this exam in Blackboard that you should review before you write the exam.</strong></p>

<hr />

<p>The 1102 Exam will be a mix of short answer and long-form questions. As is noted below, there will be a section that requires some short definitional examples and a section that requires longer, more thoughtful, responses to passages selected from the required texts we encountered in the first half of the course. </p>

<p>In the preview below, I will work through my expectations for each section. The exam will look like what you see below, but will&#8211;obviously&#8211;have specific questions. </p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Section I</strong>: Identify and define the seven (7) terms below in their context of relevance to this course. I.e., briefly suggest for each what/who it is, major defining characteristic(s), and/or its conceptual importance to the topics we’ve been studying, and perhaps, an example.<br/>
7 questions x 3 points each = 21 (Maximum 200 words for each question)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the section above, I am looking for definitions that reflect how the term was applied, understood, and used in the course. I am <strong>not</strong> looking for a dictionary definition. You should always define the term, as the question notes, &#8220;in their context of relevance to this course.&#8221; That means any term you see in this section needs to be connected to how we discussed the term, or how the lectures defined the term, or how the readings addressed the term.</p>

<p>Always take note of the points awarded for the question. In Section I, each definition you offer is worth three points. As a result, you should cover roughly three major elements of the term. If you see a term such as &#8220;violence,&#8221; you would first define it as a theme (see how this is not the dictionary definition). Then you would refer to how <em>JPod</em> addressed the theme of violence. Then, you might point to a specific example: the murder in <em>JPod</em> or the bullying. </p>

<p>Remember that I am testing both your comprehension and your application. I am assessing whether or not you did the reading (can you recognize the term) <strong>and</strong> whether you know how to apply that term or why that term might be relevant to the course. If you read the question, you&#8217;ll note that it states: &#8220;identify and define.&#8221; That means, at bare minimum, you need to do both. Identify the term (where did it come from, why is it on the exam?) and define (how would we use it, what text shaped our understanding if the term?). Both the identify and define portions of the question require you to do so &#8220;in the context of relevance to this course&#8221;&#8211;so your reply should reference how the term is identified in the course and defined in the course. </p>

<p>This section cannot be in point form; you must write full sentences. You should have a minimum of three sentences and a maximum of seven. Try to stay within the maximum word count. The word count is a statement, to some extent, of my expectations. If you&#8217;re babbling on for 350 words, you either don&#8217;t know the answer or you are over-answering. Doing either of these things will impact your grade. In this section, you either know the answer or you don&#8217;t. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Section II: Below are quotations from the novels we have been studying so far. For each quotation, identify and explain the significance as it is related to any of the interpretive concepts (i.e.: narrative, character, P.O.V.) you have been introduced to so far this semester. You may refer to events or formal elements that occur outside the quote, but your answers should directly address the quote, and the particularities evident in the quote, using the correct interpretive language (i.e.: narrative, character, P.O.V.). </p>

<p>Hint: The quotations are not designed to trick you; each has relevance to, is related to, or can help illustrate the features of one or more or the central interpretive concepts (i.e.: narrative, character, P.O.V.) we have covered in the course.<br/>
4 questions x 7 points = 28 (Maximum 350 words for each question)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this section, you can freewheel a bit more than you can in Section I. In Section II, I am asking for a close reading. You should be able to deploy (use) the literary terminology to make a comment about the impact, significance, narrative role, or development of the passage. Each passage will have multiple interpretations, so there&#8217;s a number of possible approaches to each quotation. You should rely on your knowledge of close reading strategies and your understanding of how literary terms&#8211;character, setting, symbol, etc.&#8211;work to reveal things about the text. You can refer to the role of the passage in the text generally, to situate context, but the bulk of your answer should focus in on a particular literary term as it is highlighted&#8211;or present&#8211;in the passage. </p>

<p>Again, pay attention to the point-scale. There a seven points here, so you should have something robust to say. You&#8217;ll want to develop your answers more than you did in section I. That said, the 350-word maximum, again, speaks to my expectations. Section II is not an essay question. </p>

<p>As in the section above, I am assessing whether or not you did the reading (do you know the text and the literary terms well enough) <strong>and</strong> whether you know how to apply the literary terminology to make suggestions about how the text makes meaning. The section is similar in approach to your essay, except shorter and requiring a more diverse approach. You shouldn&#8217;t answer all four questions in this section by focusing on character. Try to mix it up a bit; show me what you can do. </p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Super-Important Technical Stuff:</strong></p>

<p>The exam is closed book. I am willing to use the honour system and trust that you will keep your books closed. Please take note of the information below. If you do start looking in books, and searching for answers on the internet, you will burn all sorts of unnecessary time and you might inadvertently close your browser&#8217;s exam window. <strong>The exam will not stop for you.</strong></p>

<p>The exam will be timed. You will have one hour and fifty minutes to complete the exam (1:50). You will need to complete the exam in one sitting. <strong>The &#8220;Force Completion&#8221; option will be turned on</strong>, so make sure you are completely ready to go when you start the exam (go to the bathroom, drinks, snacks, etc. should be at the ready). Make sure you read all testing instructions carefully; the exam timer runs without pause once it is started. <strong>You cannot stop the timer; the exam will automatically submit after one hour and fifty minutes</strong>. If you are done before the time limit, you can and should submit the exam. Once you are ready to submit, click &#8220;submit.&#8221; </p>

<p>Make sure your internet connection is reliable. If you lose your connection or your connection is too slow, you could be &#8220;kicked out&#8221; of the test and not allowed back in. <strong>If you leave the exam at any point, in Blackboard, you will not be allowed back into the exam. Once you start the exam, you are committed to finishing it.</strong> </p>

<p>The exam will be available for 24 hours starting at 5am Feb. 22, 2017 and ending Feb. 23, 2017 at 5am in the &#8220;Course Content&#8221; section of the class Blackboard space. You can write the exam&#8211;once&#8211;any time between those hours. If you miss the available window of time, you cannot write the exam. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>English 1102 (Online) Activity Prompt #6 - Week 9<br/>
Complete by March 1, 2017<br/>
Winter 2017 - Douglas College - David N. Wright</strong> </p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Outcomes Statement:</strong> This activity prompt is designed to get you thinking about how <em>Ready Player One</em> emphasizes games and gameplay in order to help us visualize situations and question the nature of reality.</p>

<p><strong>Task:</strong></p>

<p>Think about&#8211;and actually design&#8211;a playable board game that corresponds to <em>Ready Player One</em>. </p>

<p>Some things to think about:</p>

<ol>
<li>What parts of the novel does your board game emphasize and why?</li>
<li>How does a board game&#8211;or any game&#8211;leverage the interpretative skills for things such as character, setting, and symbol?</li>
<li>How does your board game use icons, or symbols, to represent things?</li>
<li>How does your board game recreate the act of reading and interpretation in its playing? In other words, how does the game recreate the act of reading the novel?</li>
<li>How does your board game represent the &#8220;reality&#8221; of the <em>OASIS</em>, assuming it even represents the <em>OASIS</em> (no reason that it must!).</li>
</ol>

<hr />

<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>

<p>Designing a board game can be an interesting way of gaining insights about our reading. How we visualize&#8211;or represent&#8211;the narrative, plot-line, characters in the novel can tell us a lot about how we are &#8220;reading&#8221; them. Understanding how we &#8220;read&#8221; novels&#8211;how we actually visualize the content&#8211;tells us a lot about how we perceive reality. It might suggest that, despite our best efforts otherwise, we view reality myopically&#8211;from only our own perspective. </p>

<p>At the same time, thinking about the rules the govern the gameplay of your board game can reveal assumptions about the act of reading itself. In other words, how do the rules for games <em>make</em> us play it in a particular way? As your instructor, I am in effect making you read the novels and poetry in this course according to a theme (the hacker or technology). That move influences how you read the novels in the same way that <em>Scrabble</em> influences how many words you can make by only allowing you seven letters at a time. </p>

<p>When you respond to this activity prompt, tell us about the thought process behind some of your decisions, don&#8217;t focus only on the rules / look of the game&#8211;but we&#8217;re interested in that too!!</p>

<p>Feel free to upload a picture of the game if you actually make it&#8211;and you should!!</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Outcomes Statement:</strong> This activity prompt is designed to get you thinking about how <em>Ready Player One</em> emphasizes intertextual references to the 1980s, particularly pop cultural references.</p>

<p><strong>Task:</strong></p>

<p>After choosing a single chapter in the novel, make a list of all the references that signal the 1980s. Note that there are some chapters that have many references to the 1980s and some that have very few. Choose your chapter based on the amount of work you want to put into the activity. </p>

<p>Once you have your list, do a quick online search and see if you can find a tangible example of each reference. You&#8217;re not looking for Wikipedia-type explanations here; you&#8217;re looking for things such as YouTube videos of the actual television show or song or a picture of the actual item. </p>

<p>Now that you have built an archive of all the references, think about what&#8217;s missing or what was abundant and make a suggestion about what they might mean. For instance, if a reference was mentioned in the book but there was no tangible example, what does that mean for our ability to grasp the metaphor it might represent? Or, if it is abundant, what might that suggest about how the book is exploiting popularity to make the book&#8217;s metaphors more clear. </p>

<p>This Activity Prompt is about seeing how intertextual references make meaning in a text. The text represents a specific kind of reality because of how it discriminates those references&#8211;we&#8217;re interested both in what&#8217;s there, but also in what&#8217;s not there. In others words, if you find yourself thinking about what the book leaves out, you&#8217;re raising some interesting questions about the nature of representation in cultural production. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;re turning our attention toward writing the next essay (questions posted soon) and building a familiarity with some of the skills you might want to use in order to complete the essay. Try not to forget about the role of Stuart Hall&#8217;s <a href="http://digitalcultureslab.ca/douglascollege-online1102/winter2017/lecture-module-7/">Encoding / Decoding</a> and the role it plays in the final essay questions. You will need to have a steady grasp of Hall&#8217;s reading process guidelines to really excel. </p>

<p>Let&#8217;s begin with a close reading of the first chapter of <em>Ready Player One</em>. Labelled &#8220;001,&#8221; the first chapter has references to many specific things&#8211;characters, 1980s references, cultural artifacts. We want to start to catalogue these so that we can reflect upon how the symbolic meaning of these things builds as we progress through the novel. There are a few ways to go about this: </p>

<ol>
<li>Make a list of tangible things mentioned in the novel. Be very specific about what it is&#8211;no &#8220;aspects&#8221; or &#8220;areas&#8221;; name the actual thing to which you or the novel are referring.</li>
<li>Assign a value to the things you have collected. Who is it important to&#8211;the answer here might be Wade, the audience, the reader, another character, the narrative sequence, allusion, or many other literary elements and expectations</li>
<li>Think next about how you know what you know in the novel. Who (character, narrator) or what (setting, symbol, metaphor, cultural reference) is helping you understand what&#8217;s happening or interpreting things / people for you? How are they doing that? Why are they doing that? In short, we&#8217;re thinking here about motivations&#8211;what is the motivation for making meaning the way it is being made?</li>
</ol>

<hr />

<p>As we work toward an interpretive paradigm&#8211;a way of &#8220;doing&#8221; the work of literary interpretation and writing about it, I want you to keep in mind the distinctions between &#8220;game&#8221; and &#8220;play&#8221;:</p>

<p>Game: </p>

<ul>
<li>rules</li>
<li>order</li>
<li>multiple players</li>
<li>a distinct winner / loser</li>
<li>repeated gaming is rewarded (you get better at it)</li>
<li>specific location - board, screen, space</li>
</ul>

<p>Play: </p>

<ul>
<li>ad-hoc (no rules)</li>
<li>anyone can join at any point and change direction of the group</li>
<li>each individual brings their own take on the play (no rules to consult)</li>
<li>no winner / loser (unfolds how it unfolds, where it unfolds)</li>
<li>needs no &#8220;location&#8221; (largely imaginative), no reward for repeated play</li>
</ul>

<p>Some other things to keep in mind: </p>

<ul>
<li>Think about how objects function as symbols in games&#8211;what is representing what?</li>
<li>Note the different types of games: Poker, Blackjack, Risk, Trivial Pursuit, to name a few

<ul>
<li>what do they have in common?

<ul>
<li>strategy game (Risk, Poker, Scrabble, etc.)</li>
<li>bluff game (Poker, Blackjack, Bridge)</li>
<li>intelligence game (Scrabble, Bridge)</li>
<li>pattern game (Crazy Eights, Cribbage, Bridge, First-Person Shooter)</li>
<li>Error game (Tic-Tac-Toe)</li>
<li>Role-playing Game (shooters, etc.)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Expectations then fold into how we understand and play the game&#8211;much as they do when we read&#8211;genre&#8211;poetry, fiction, comic book, play&#8211;often determines our expectation, for example.</li>
</ul>

<p>How does our conception of &#8220;game&#8221; apply to thinking about character perspective and theme?</p>

<ul>
<li>Games often built around a central theme that does not change despite different strategies:

<ul>
<li>Clue = murder</li>
<li>Monopoly = money</li>
<li>Risk = War</li>
<li>Grand Theft Auto = Crime</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Objective is often to work within the theme in a different way in order to win the game

<ul>
<li>theme does not change but the attitude toward it does</li>
<li>Easter Eggs - repeated play or collaborative play</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>How then is interpretation like playing a game?
- There are rules, you need to play within them
- Rewards creative gameplay &#8211; the ability to move within the rules toward new discovery
- Think about how the game discriminates and represents</p>

<hr />

<p>Take a close look at two specific quotations from <em>Ready Player One</em>. What we&#8217;re trying to do here is look for the implications these passages suggest for: 1) Wade’s character; 2) descriptive words used to describe women; 3) absent or coded references.</p>

<p>We want to focus our attention first on surfaces&#8211;what&#8217;s going on, who&#8217;s speaking, where are we in the novel&#8211;then we want to look underneath and think more deeply about the nature of the representation being offered. We want to ask questions such as these:</p>

<ul>
<li>What do these descriptions tell us about Wade’s biases, or how he sees the world?</li>
<li>What are the words—exactly—that are used to describe; what do they signal about the character, what do they reveal? Do the terms suggest any particular way of “reading”—or making meaning in—the character</li>
<li>What’s missing from the descriptions? What assumptions are we making as readers about the characters? (What’s the picture in our mind and how is that picture being put together?)</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are the two quotes: </p>

<p>“At the very top was a school photo of a young girl with a distinctly sad smile. To my surprise, she looked almost identical to her avatar. The same dark hair, the same hazel eyes, and the same beautiful face I knew so well—with one small difference. Most of the left half of her face was covered with a reddish-purple birthmark. I would later learn that these types of birthmark were sometimes referred to as ‘port-wine stains.’ In the photo, she wore a weep of her dark hair down over her left eye to try to conceal the mark as much as possible.” (291)</p>

<p>“A heavyset African American girl sat in the RV’s driver seat, clutching the wheel tightly and staring straight ahead. She was about my age, with short, kinky hair and chocolate-colored skin that appeared iridescent in the soft glow of the dashboard indicators. She was wearing a vintage Rush 2112 concert shirt, and the numbers were warped around her large bosom. She appeared to be shivering, even though it was nice and warm in the cab.” (318)</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Outcomes Statement:</strong> This activity prompt is designed to get you thinking about how <em>Ready Player One</em> proposes several different realities around games and gaming.</p>

<p><strong>Task:</strong></p>

<p>Play any of the games below (as often as you like!):</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.tripletsandus.com/80s/80s_games/html5_galaga.htm">Galaga</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.atari.com/arcade#!/arcade/atari-promo">Atari Games</a></li>
<li><a href="http://tripletsandus.com/80s/80s_games/joust_shockwave2.htm">Joust</a></li>
<li><a href="http://my.ign.com/atari/adventure">Adventure</a></li>
<li><a href="http://playdosgamesonline.com/zork-i.html">Zork</a></li>
<li><a href="http://play-roms.com/coin-op-arcade/black-tiger#">Black Tiger</a> (*works best on Firefox browser; takes a bit to load)</li>
<li><a href="http://my.ign.com/atari/tempest">Tempest</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Once you have steeped yourself in the experience of retro video games, think about how <em>Ready Player One</em> represents these games. In the discussion thread, comment on the experience of playing the games versus your experience reading about them in <em>Ready Player One</em>. Did you know about the games in <em>Ready Player One</em> before you read about them? Did the experience of playing them yourself match the experience of playing them that Wade describes&#8211;did <em>Joust</em> live up to the billing? What was your perception of the games based on the fiction compared to your perception of the game when you played it online?</p>

<p>The discussion being encouraged here is one around the perception of reality. How do we perceive realities when we read them in a novel? How are characters manipulating realities and making them conform to the expectations of the narrative they are building? How must settings and symbols be manipulated in the game world in order to match real world expectations? </p>

<p>Games and gaming is a big theme in <em>Ready Player One</em>, how does playing games yourself give you insight into the text and its symbology? In other words, what role did your cultural capital play in how you decoded (Hall!) the text? </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>English 1102 (Online) Activity Prompt #9 - Week 12<br/>
Complete by March 22, 2017<br/>
Winter 2017 - Douglas College - David N. Wright</strong> </p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Outcomes Statement:</strong> This activity prompt is designed to get you thinking about how <em>The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage</em> challenges us to think about how we read images and words together.</p>

<p><strong>Task:</strong></p>

<p>Pick any advertisement you like, as long as it appears in paper (or as a sign / billboard&#8211;no commercials or web ads). consider how the words work with the image by addressing some of the approaches below:</p>

<ul>
<li>How do the words reflect the image (how do they interact with each other)?</li>
<li>How do the words resist the image (does the image &#8220;say&#8221; something different than the words)?</li>
<li>What position are the words in relative to the image (where is the image; where are the words)?</li>
<li>What &#8220;style&#8221; is the image? Is it drawn, a photograph, an abstraction?</li>
<li>What &#8220;style&#8221; is the writing? Big letters, small letters, san serif, easy to read, hard to decipher?</li>
<li>What comments can you make about the general design of the image and the words? Are the words horizontal when the picture is vertical? What is the orientation of the ad&#8211;portrait or landscape?</li>
</ul>

<p>Once you&#8217;ve done some of this preliminary work, make a claim about how the images and words work together the emphasize a theme. Or, you might explore how the interplay between the words and the image leads to interesting, but conflicting, meanings. In short, explore how image and word work together to reflect the characteristics of theme. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;ve slowed things down over the last couple of weeks. This is on purpose. I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve been rolling through mid-terms and other commitments, and I wanted to give everyone time to acclimate and get caught up with the reading. If you&#8217;re not caught up, finished <em>Ready Player One</em> and <em>The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage</em>, you better get cracking&#8211;there&#8217;s only four weeks left in the course!!</p>

<p>In any event, this week I wanted to pick up on some themes in <em>Ready Player One</em> with a mind to get you thinking about how you might approach the questions in the second Essay Assignment. There are a few basic things to remember about <em>Ready Player One</em> from a comprehension standpoint. Things that inform the themes and their interpretation through the text. At the same time, we need to remember to base our analysis in deploying the literary terms first, and then building up to make a claim about what themes are important in the text. </p>

<p>One thing I like to emphasize about <em>Ready Player One</em> is that everyone in the novel is playing the game. All the main characters are involved in the Egg Hunt. This is important because right of the top, we have a connection to games, and the idea of game play, which I reviewed in an earlier lecture (Module 10, to be exact). Games are interesting because, like themes, the baseline &#8220;types&#8221; or &#8220;forms&#8221; for games are consistent throughout history and even across cultures. In fact, understanding how games are consistent forms of representation can help contextualize how we should look at themes. Keeping that idea of consistency and congruency in mind, let&#8217;s walk through some themes in <em>Ready Player One</em> and their characteristics. </p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Reality (or different <em>kinds of</em> reality):</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The question the text makes us ask is: &#8220;what version of reality are we in and when are we in it?&#8221;

<ul>
<li>Is The OASIS a real place? And if so, what makes it real?</li>
<li>When would we say Wade, Helen, and Art3mis are in a reality? Is it all the time? What reality do they occupy?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The point here is that setting plays a big role in helping us explore the theme of reality

<ul>
<li>What determines a character&#8217;s perspective (POV) of that reality?</li>
<li>How does a character behave or look differently depending on the reality they find themselves in?</li>
<li>What are the layers of reality? (at one point, Wade is in a headset in one reality; inside The OASIS generally; then in a specific place in The OASIS; then mimicking the plot-line to a movie (<em>War Games</em>) that is itself set in a real-world fiction&#8211;it&#8217;s very hard to keep track of where reality starts and fantasy begins)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Is the OASIS a positive space? If so, what about it signals a positive space? How is it relative to the Stacks for instance? What is being emphasized in the OASIS? (games, education, the 1980s, alternative worlds, avatars&#8230;) What is being ignored in the OASIS? (This leads us to other themes: Escapism, Willful Ignorance, Neglect, Family&#8230;) See, everything just comes pouring out once you turn on the tap&#8230;)</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p><strong>Identity / Persona / Appearance:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>We&#8217;ve looked at all of the above in one form or another throughout the course, but they all merge nicely in <em>Ready Player One</em> to emphasize the role things such as appearance play in our representation or the cultural qualities we want to represent (themes such as rebellion, belonging, manipulation, truth, being).

<ul>
<li>Who is who in <em>Ready Player One</em>?

<ul>
<li>And, importantly, when are they who they are? (it can all get to be a bit like going down an endless rabbit-hole of representation&#8211;when it what when it is what it is&#8230;!?!?!? BUT:)</li>
<li>Is the main character in the novel Wade, or his avatar / persona Parzival?</li>
<li>Is Aech a Caucasian male or a African American Lesbian named Helen?</li>
<li>Does Art3mis have a birthmark or not?</li>
<li>Is Anorak alive and Halliday dead or is Halliday alive through Anorak?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In short, there are implications for each character when we consider how their identity is tied up in personas, appearances, and reality (see above).</li>
<li>As well, we should be noting how the characters &#8220;negotiate&#8221; (referring to Stuart Hall here, hence the quotes) their surroundings and read interpretations from other people, which shape how they represent themselves (Aech and Wade especially, but other too to some extent)</li>
<li>The above is particularly important when one considers the implications of the IOI Sixer&#8217;s uniformity (or conformity); to be a Gunter is to be against the power structures, to be outcast. At the same time though, there is uniformity in the Gunter&#8217;s non-conformity.</li>
<li>We need to start thinking about how exclusion is itself a form of inclusion&#8211;these oppositional modes are important for thinking about how themes operate to make the text mean something.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Perspective:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>The notion of perspective comes out of Point-of-View, something we&#8217;ve touched on frequently throughout the course as well. In <em>Ready Player One</em>, there are shifting perspectives in the narrative that we should account for in our analysis. </p></li>
<li>First, what does the narrative tell us about how the events are being interpreted?

<ul>
<li>As with <em>Mr. Penumbra&#8217;s 24-Hour Bookstore</em>, the perspective of the narrator in <em>Ready Player One</em> in from the future&#8211;the events of the narrative have already transpired. This allows the narrator&#8211;nominally Wade, but sometimes Halliday&#8211;to potentially reinterpret or emphasize / exploit certain areas of the narrative for effect.</li>
<li>One might ask: when does Wade choose his avatar? The name Parzival, as we are told, references the knight who gets ahold of the holy grail. Might the narrative perspective, coupled with the events of the story, and the significance of Wade&#8217;s role in it allow us to push on the trustworthiness of Wade&#8217;s account, particularly the symbology and the emphasis placed upon it in the story? Maybe.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Second, we might look at how the narrative designed to favour one perspective?

<ul>
<li>For instance, the narrator certainly favours the 1980s, as does the content and symbology of the novel.</li>
<li>As well, as noted above, the novel favours popular culture and the perspectives it offers on the past rather than say, High Art (what we find in museums) or Socio-Cultural Contexts (politics, nationalism, social movements, economics).</li>
<li>While socio-cultural contexts are mentioned, they are primarily mentioned as places characters must escape from&#8211;there is little offered in the way of interpretation; whereas the popular culture symbols and sidebars are worked over significantly.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Third, there&#8217;s the idea of perspective in gaming. What or how the player looks at the action and how this translates into how we &#8220;read&#8221; the text&#8211;how we visualize the action:

<ul>
<li>Some perspective types common to video games: MMORPG (The OASIS), First-person shooter, over-the-shoulder, fly on the wall, role playing.</li>
<li>Note how closely these perspectives resemble the modes in which we might interpret literature.</li>
</ul>

<hr /></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Briskly (run through the text and see if you can find examples that will answer some of the questions posed below:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Power:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Who has it and why? Think about perspectives above: can we trust Wade&#8217;s power position as narrator? What above Halliday? How does he hold onto power?</li>
<li>What about Sorrento and Morrow (and his dead wife)? What kind of power do they have and how to they wield it?</li>
<li>Power in the novel, at least form the perspective that we see it most of the time, is based on cultural capital. What about characters who do not have cultural capital? What happens to them? What are the implications of what&#8217;s happening to them and what does this say about how we understand power?</li>
<li>power in the novel is also based on esoteric knowledge&#8211;ignores real themes of humanity in favour of entertainment (note perspectives above). All the clues come not from deep contemplation about the nature of being, but from video games from the 1980s.

<ul>
<li>Unlike the epic, the learning the characters do is not necessarily going to make you a better person or a better citizen. In fact, it might have the opposite effect, pulling people out of the public discourse in favour of &#8220;playing the game&#8221; (who&#8217;s <strong>not</strong> playing?).</li>
<li>Think about how the book reinforces stereotypes about gaming at the same time as it holds games up as a significant metaphor for life in the near-future.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p><strong>History:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Think carefully, in light of everything above, about how the novel frames the 1980s. Watch some YouTube videos about the 1980s and see if you think the book gets it right. How and how not?</li>
<li>The deployment of mythology, legend, and epic modes for story-telling. All the features of the epic are present in the novel&#8211;hero, quest, catalogues&#8211;as well as aspects of mythology&#8211;knights of the round table&#8211;and legend (as both metaphor (<em>The Legend of Zelda</em> and as recent history: the legend of Steve Jobs and its connection to Halliday&#8217;s character)</li>
<li>If, as most would argue, history and our understanding of it informs our behaviour, our ability to navigate the world, the what about the &#8220;made up&#8221; or &#8220;fictionalized&#8221; history in the novel?</li>
<li>How does the novel need to construct a history in order for it to work?</li>
<li>How is the history in the novel, stemming from the above, reflect a Western or &#8220;Euro-centric&#8221; worldview? What are the implications of such a position? How does <em>Ready Player One</em> colonize (look it up) the act of gameplay and/or its representation?</li>
<li>What is the role of video game history&#8211;or entertainment history&#8211;in the novel? How does this pressure our understanding of what history should be about? Is there room for this kind of pop-culture history? Is <em>TMZ</em> history?</li>
</ul>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the interesting things about <em>The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage</em> is how it unapologetically reinvents historical events to represent some interesting questions about computers&#8211;or computation&#8211;and some of the assumptions we make about the representation of characters who interact with computers. The story draws a lot from erased histories about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_computing">role of women</a> in the early phases of computer history. </p>

<p>One of the themes we should be thinking about this week&#8211;and it&#8217;s a doozy&#8211;is erasure. Another related theme is &#8220;the other.&#8221; In both cases, these themes reflect a &#8220;normative&#8221; situation and the way that &#8220;normative&#8221; situation often excludes or &#8220;erases&#8221; things that it does not recognize. </p>

<p>Normative means the prevailing cultural current or, if you want to be more basic about it, that which we accept as normal (in the sense that the majority would acknowledge it as such). For instance, representations of heterosexual love is &#8220;normative&#8221; in that most people accept that representation as the &#8220;normal&#8221; way for love to be represented. However, this representation excludes and erases all other forms of love. Our job as conscientious readers is to think about the implications of our assumptions about what is &#8220;normal.&#8221; For instance, we should think about how histories are erased when we track our &#8220;progress&#8221; through time. There&#8217;s an old saying that &#8220;history is written by the winners.&#8221; That phrase encapsulates to some extent the erasure of the loser when it comes to recording and representing the past. One of the things that <em>The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage</em> does is try to restore these erased histories, albeit through a fiction. </p>

<p>At the same time, normative situations necessarily create opposition because who wants to accept the status quo. As a result, literary and cultural criticism has contextualized this fact by thinking about &#8220;the other&#8221; or that which stands in opposition to the normative (whatever it might be). So, in the case of <em>The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage</em>, there are several instances of &#8220;othering.&#8221; One is that the text is a comic and not a novel or poem. Maybe you didn&#8217;t expect that in an English Literature course? If not, then the text itself is an &#8220;other&#8221;; you might think less of the text because it is a comic book, or feel it is easier to read. In these cases, the novel or poem would be the normative, and the comic book the &#8220;other.&#8221; While the text does not erase anything, the expectations for the &#8220;other&#8221; are set by our expectations of what is normal. </p>

<p>Moreover, <em>The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage</em> works to restore the history of women in comics, offers numerous rigorous footnotes, and deep dives into all sorts of Victorian themes contrasting these themes with assumptions common to our own time and to our own sense of the historical record. In so doing, the comic represents a lot of what we might call &#8220;otherness&#8221; or &#8220;erasure.&#8221; What we need to do is ask a lot of questions about what&#8217;s missing, what assumptions are being played with, and what are our expectations for a text such as this?</p>

<p>Finally, for now, we want to think about how our assumptions are formed and what it means to be &#8220;other&#8221; or &#8220;erased,&#8221; particularly when we think about Stuart Hall&#8217;s &#8220;resistant reading.&#8221; For instance, how might an &#8220;othered&#8221; or &#8220;erased&#8221; population respond to texts that attempt to erase or exclude them? How do they inset themselves in the representation? Where? Why? To what end? </p>

<p>There&#8217;s some pretty interesting examples to play with here, but some might be put this way:</p>

<ul>
<li>Erasure in labour: how do we erase the labour that produces the goods we consume? Do you know who made your cell phone, the food you eat, the car you drive, the gasoline that powers it?</li>
<li>Erasure in education: what groups are excluded from educational narratives&#8211;what do we learn and why? Indigenous peoples have largely been excluded from histories of Canada or they have only been understood <em>in reference to</em> Anglo-Saxon histories. Why might this be an issue? How do we deal with it?</li>
<li>Women as &#8220;other&#8221;: next week, we&#8217;ll look more closely at this concept, but suffice to say: how does <em>The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage</em> write in a female history where there isn&#8217;t one? How does it deal with Victorian representations of women&#8211;which often positioned female characters as &#8220;savage&#8221; or crazy, hysterical, and gossipers, incapable of reasonable thought, only out for marriage.</li>
</ul>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What we&#8217;re looking for in <em>The Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage</em> is how the novel represents a nice exit point for some of the major themes of the course&#8211;the quest, friendship, immortality, history, alternative universes (or spaces), technology&#8211;and also brings us to encounter interesting questions around gender, erased histories, the value of cultural capital, and the &#8220;other.&#8221; In short, <em>The Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage</em> represents a capstone novel of the course. </p>

<p>What I&#8217;ll do here is pick up on some of the subjects we discussed in class and try to model ways of interpreting or &#8220;interrogating&#8221; the text so that we can make comments about its significance and how it makes meaning. But first, a few assumptions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Remember that we need to account for our expectations as readers. We need to understand how the text and its story match with what we expect or, more importantly, how and where it doesn&#8217;t match those expectations. Note that this doesn&#8217;t mean assessing whether or not the novel is good or bad; expectations need centre around questions of <strong>meaning</strong> not value. We talked about these fractures early on in the course; places where the narrative logic is broken, characters behave in ways that make us curious about their motivations, the setting shifts and brings other locales and spaces into opposition or comparison. We should entirely avoid comments about author intentions or the text&#8217;s ability to be &#8220;effective,&#8221; &#8220;realistic,&#8221; have &#8220;aspects of&#8221; anything&#8211;&#8220;Padua is very effective at aspects of realism&#8230;&#8221;&#8211;and move toward the analysis&#8211;&#8220;The character of Lovelace represents a significant shift in representations of the Victorian female&#8230;&#8221;</li>
<li>Meaning does not exist in a vacuum. As I noted when we played the video games, we bring a lot of cultural capital to our understanding of what we read (or play!). We fill in a lot of blanks. We also miss many references if we do not have the cultural capital to understand immediately. It&#8217;s important for you to do some sleuthing on your own and figure out what some of the contexts for your readings are, but <em>The Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage</em> does that in the footnotes too. Take the time to bring the context into the reading of the novel, much as the video games we played made <em>Ready Player One</em> a little more accessible.</li>
<li><em>The Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage</em> is a speculative reading that reimagines a history that did not happen. One could argue that all the books we have read (poems such as &#8220;Agrippa&#8221; and &#8220;Sestina&#8221; too!) are imagined pasts&#8211;fictions that recount imaginary events&#8211;virtual worlds (&#8220;Pocket Universe,&#8221; &#8220;The OASIS,&#8221; &#8220;Agrippa&#8221;&#8217;s photo album, Google, meeting Douglas Coupland in Douglas Coupland&#8217;s book). The point here is that this tells us something both about how fiction is constructed (based on reality but not reality) and also how we choose to represent the past (always in relation to some event, some narrative retelling of a story). All the texts we have read in the second half of the course begin after the events have occurred. History then, and how we create, represent, and interpret it, is a looming elephant. When we think about what&#8217;s missing, left out, misrepresented, or outright made up, the stability of meaning takes a hit&#8211;and that&#8217;s where we want to focus our attention.</li>
<li><em>The Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage</em> is a comic book (or, if you&#8217;re more nerdy, a graphic novel). It represents things in a very different way than a text of only written prose. Try to think about how to account for the differences between a visualized narrative and a written one. What do I mean? Well, think about how space is used in <em>The Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage</em>&#8211;figures appear all over the page. Sometimes, we move from left to right and mimic the act of reading (itself a historically-bound form of cultural knowledge) and other times we don&#8217;t move at all; still other times we move all over the page in different or without a traditional left-to-right logic. How then does this change the act of reading?</li>
</ol>

<hr />

<p><strong>Okay, now that we&#8217;ve covered that off, on to the MULTIVERSE OF INTERPRETATION!!</strong></p>

<p>In the following, I present an image from the text and interrogate it. See if you can follow the logic and to some extent try to deploy that scaffolding&#8211;the logic of my interpretation, not <em>my interpretation</em>&#8211;to your own reading of a passage. In every case below, I am analyzing and / or interpreting, but I&#8217;m not saying which and when&#8211;you do some work! [winkface]</p>

<p>[See below, how I am imitating the <em>footnote</em> style of the book? That&#8217;s me being clever; but you should have known and recognized the allusion (wait! that&#8217;s a key term! what does that even mean!? will it be on the exam!? (I&#8217;ll wait)]</p>

<p>*This final panel (that&#8217;s what we call the squares or group of squares that makes up the novel&#8217;s text) of the narrative proper&#8211;there are lots of other drawings, but they come as part of the endnotes&#8211;nicely encapsulates some of the novel&#8217;s major interjections:</p>

<ol>
<li>It alludes to the &#8220;The Person from Porlock&#8221; anecdote that ended section one and began the larger narrative, thus closing off the text by referring to its beginning. That in and of itself is an interesting maneuver because it suggests coherence in what is a very fractured and disconnected sequence of stories&#8211;the text is not a long, drawn out, story but rather a sequence of short stories about different &#8220;adventures&#8221; that the two characters go on.</li>
<li>It suggests that Ada knows the truth&#8211;the real history&#8211;despite her adventures in the &#8220;Pocket Universe.&#8221; At the same time, her &#8220;crazy&#8221; appearance&#8211;big eyes, frazzled hair, compressed gait&#8211;re-establish her within the representational confines of the Victorian Woman or, how women were portrayed and thought-of in the Victorian era, as fragile and potential hysterical. If we turn the page in the novel, we see the Rabbit from <em>Alice in Wonderland</em>, an inter-textual reference to a girl&#8217;s fantasy world; I&#8217;ll let that one sit with you (BUT WHAT ARE THE PARALLELS???? (sorry&#8230; I couldn&#8217;t let it sit&#8230; how is this book that&#8217; s maybe all about restoring Ada Lovelace and representing powerful women now thwarted by putting in a reference to <em>Alice in Wonderland</em>&#8230; maybe empowered women <em>is</em> a fantasy world&#8230; no&#8230; wait!! &#8220;Wonderland&#8221; is another virtual world!! We&#8217;ve been discussing those in the course&#8230; wow&#8230; mind[blown]mind).</li>
<li>The question about &#8220;madness&#8221; (as in insanity) asked at the end is an interesting one, both as it references the hysterical woman in Victorian-era England generally, but also the uncertainty that Ada Lovelace&#8217;s temporal shift&#8211;she knows the truth&#8211;creates in the reader. Madness is a central theme in digital culture as well&#8211;all the great tech inventors are crazy, think of Apple&#8217;s ad campaigns in the late 1990s.</li>
</ol>

<p>*Note how all but a few of the &#8220;crazy ones&#8221; are artists (the others are outsiders, political non-conformists. What might that say about how Apple wants us to think of &#8220;crazy&#8221;? </p>

<p>*If you are interested in representations of women in the Victorian Era, read &#8220;The Yellow Wallpaper&#8221; by Charlotte Perkins Gilman and <em>Madwoman in the Attic</em> by Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar. But I digress&#8230;</p>

<hr />

<div>[caption id="attachment_314" align="aligncenter" width="768"]<img src="http://digitalcultureslab.ca/hybrid1102/fall2016-001/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_0350-768x1024.jpg" alt="Padua 29" width="768" height="1024" class="size-large wp-image-314" /> Padua 29[/caption]</div>

<p>*This image is interesting because it both tells us the truth about the past&#8211;brevity is its strong suit&#8211;and hints at how we should understand the book. In other words, it alludes the the kind of cultural capital we will have to deploy to fully understand the novel&#8217;s reference point: how the Victorian Era is similar to our own Era, particularly as it involves technology and computers. So, from this page onward, we are looking for symbols, metaphors, settings, representations, characteristics that signal computers, technology or digital culture.</p>

<p>Imagine how we would read the book if that last line, &#8220;The first computers were not built until the 1940s,&#8221; were not present. </p>

<p>You might also want to think about that word &#8220;computers.&#8221; The term <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_computer">computer</a> used to refer to the women who did the computation. Is this a hint that true woman&#8217;s liberation didn&#8217;t happen until the 1940s? WIKI Could be. Kinda true. Anyhoo, take a look at the entry on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer">computers</a> at wikipedia&#8230; no mention of Ada. hmmm&#8230;.erased. But Babbage is mentioned in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace">Ada Lovelace</a> entry&#8230;</p>

<p>If you follow the etymology of computers along, it would appear that all computers are women&#8230;</p>

<div>[caption id="attachment_322" align="aligncenter" width="768"]<img src="http://digitalcultureslab.ca/hybrid1102/fall2016-001/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_0357-768x1024.jpg" alt="Padua 80" width="768" height="1024" class="size-large wp-image-322" /> Padua 80[/caption]</div>

<div>[caption id="attachment_323" align="aligncenter" width="768"]<img src="http://digitalcultureslab.ca/hybrid1102/fall2016-001/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_0358-768x1024.jpg" alt="Padua 81" width="768" height="1024" class="size-large wp-image-323" /> Padua 81[/caption]</div>

<p>*This page is interesting in the way that it blends temporal periods to force into reflections about the nature of technology and its purpose&#8211;or lack of purpose for that matter. The pages are also a good example of how the footnotes work in <em>The Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage</em>.</p>

<p>The Queen&#8217;s reaction to the Difference Engine extends her initial preoccupation with everything that the machine <em>doesn&#8217;t</em> do. She wants &#8220;our difference engine&#8221; to fight crime and is convinced of its worth only when it produces a kitten. Babbage of course, being a man of precision, is horrified to see all the errors. What&#8217;s more interesting for us though is the way the passage uses our cultural capital to inject humour into the scene. We live in an era full of internet LOL cats, and the Duke&#8217;s &#8220;LOL!&#8221; exclamation reminds us of them. The statement trivializes the role of technology, suggesting that its only real use is as entertainment. </p>

<p>The footnotes further qualify the situation by humanizing computers as things that are &#8220;yearning to express themselves artisitically.&#8221; The inclusion of such a footnote&#8211;computers, in most cases are unthinking and inanimate without a human interfacing with them&#8211;prioritizes the role of the arts and the place of the arts as the dominate or normative form of expression. The book then is about art, not computers. The book is about how to make art&#8211;which happens to be represented through the symbol of the Difference Engine&#8211;itself now a machine that helps Ada produce trivial picutres of cats that another woman also enjoys (see, go back up top and think about how all the women looking at cats and enjoying it makes them appear shallow and incapable of grasping complex computations and reason&#8211;another subversion of female empowerment despite representations otherwise in the book. </p>

<p>The other footnotes, on page 81, again references a Victorian figure of importance&#8211;Sherlock Holmes (you know him as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_(TV_series)">Benedict Cumberbatch</a>; another great example of speculative reading about Victorian Era London placed in the present day). The footnote&#8217;s referencing of an academic paper also hints at the narrator&#8217;s expertise&#8211;or lack thereof&#8211;in understanding the intricacies of Victorian England. The narrator&#8211;the voice speaking in the footnotes&#8211;is just as unclear about things, but has done some reading and now assures us that they understand the nuances of Victorian Knighthoods. While we have no evidence to support skepticism, we can at least identify with this narrator who is trying to decipher and accumulate cultural capital. </p>

<p>Suffice to say, the footnotes provide interesting interpretive context and when held up to scrutiny reveal biases and perspectives that rhyme with the way the novel is representing or reviving histories. At the same time, these pages show a diminished authority in the Queen and a lack of awareness on her part about the potential for the Difference Engine. She is not an authoritative head of state in control of two-thirds of the planet, but a vapid, presumptuous dilettante, who wields her power through complements as veiled insults&#8211;Guelphic Order. </p>

<hr />

<div>[caption id="attachment_320" align="aligncenter" width="768"]<img src="http://digitalcultureslab.ca/hybrid1102/fall2016-001/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_0355-768x1024.jpg" alt="Padua 69" width="768" height="1024" class="size-large wp-image-320" /> Padua 69[/caption]</div>

<p>*This one is real quick: Ada actually plunges into the machine and is enveloped by it. When she does so, she removes her Victorian garb, literally stripping away the constraints of society to move into the machine. It&#8217;s a powerful metaphor that represents the shedding of her restrictive dress, and the moral and intellectual codes associated with it to descend into the domain of the machine. It could also be read as a decent into hell&#8211;exactly where a sinner who strips off her morals would be thought to belong in Victorian England. That the machine surrounds her with signs that say &#8220;wrong&#8221; is a powerful commentary on her freedom from the dress.</p>

<p>*See that above: deconstruction. While the panels represent one thing, they also represent another. But, if we only read surfaces, we just buy one of the readings&#8211;depends on what we bring with us in terms of expectations&#8211;Stuart Hall. Some might resist and read these panels as a representation of female persecution, punishment for casting off the shackles of Victorian society. Some might read these panels as representative of female empowerment as she works to solve problems in a space traditionally the domain of men. </p>

<div>[caption id="attachment_328" align="aligncenter" width="768"]<img src="http://digitalcultureslab.ca/hybrid1102/fall2016-001/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_0363-768x1024.jpg" alt="Padua 142" width="768" height="1024" class="size-large wp-image-328" /> Padua 142[/caption]</div>

<div>[caption id="attachment_324" align="aligncenter" width="768"]<img src="http://digitalcultureslab.ca/hybrid1102/fall2016-001/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_0359-768x1024.jpg" alt="Padua 92" width="768" height="1024" class="size-large wp-image-324" /> Padua 92[/caption]</div>

<p>*These two examples show Babbage occupying the superficial role&#8211;at least representationally&#8211;sometimes associated with female characters. He&#8217;s obsessed not with reason and cool separation from events, but clearly has an aesthetic stake in his own representation and the representation of what he makes. He&#8217;s concerned with how he looks and how what he makes looks like. He wants to be well-liked and he wants his machine to be beautiful. It&#8217;s a very modern sense of masculinity to feel this way&#8211;and in some ways it&#8217;s still an uncomfortable representational space for men&#8211;we often give it names like &#8220;metrosexual&#8221; for instance. </p>

<p>The point here is that Babbage often plays counter-point to Lovelace&#8217;s empowered woman; whatever she takes to make herself push into masculine spaces, he loses and then takes on that which she sheds. Babbage becomes hysterical where Lovelace becomes calculating&#8211;key word to describe her charateristics that one; Babbage becomes superficial where Lovelace becomes concerned with application and use value. </p>

<hr />

<div>[caption id="attachment_331" align="aligncenter" width="768"]<img src="http://digitalcultureslab.ca/hybrid1102/fall2016-001/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_0365-768x1024.jpg" alt="Padua 213" width="768" height="1024" class="size-large wp-image-331" /> Padua 213[/caption]</div>

<p>Taken from the &#8220;Endnotes&#8221; of the &#8220;User Experience&#8221; chapter, this panel is a bit of an oddball. However, the reading I&#8217;m giving is not about character, so it might serve as a model for other approaches to critical interpretation of the text.</p>

<p>*The drawing is a good example of how pictorial representation (pictures) augments textual representation (words). Five billion anything is a lot, but when we try to imagine that number inside that square, we get a sense of how densely complex our computer systems really are. On the facing page (212), the narrator also clues us in on the limitations of pictorial representation noting that &#8220;The NOT circuit is too hard to draw.&#8221; One could argue that both of these images are of things that are &#8220;too hard to draw&#8221; and are thus saved by the context of words. Words tell us how to understand the picture&#8211;without the words, we&#8217;re forced into a situation where we have to guess at what something means. </p>

<p>This correlation of image and text is a very good example of how meaning does not occur in a vacuum, something I noted in class this week. Think hard about what is too hard to draw or too hard to write about. What might that be? How are we coming at texts and augmenting them with our own cultural capital in the same way that the words in the picture above help us understand and read the meaning of a black square?</p>

<p>Think about what is not &#8220;drawn&#8221; or &#8220;written&#8221;&#8211;the term &#8220;inscribed&#8221; works even better here&#8211;in this novel, and the others we have read this semester. Who / What is left out and why? Who / What is included and why?</p>

<p>Bring things, tangible, viable, interesting, present, patterned, things, together and see what consistencies emerge. Think about how these things make suggestions to you about what they mean. Think about how your context is put to use in the fictions you read to manipulate how you receive meaning&#8211;for good and bad.</p>

<p>*As a final nugget, I&#8217;ll leave you with this: what if Lovelace and Babbage were South Asian? What would need to change? Could we still write about Victorian England? Could we still write about a kind of Difference Engine? Probably not, right? So, this tells us that while the book pushes for empowerment, pushes us to think more broadly about the invention of computers and the gender / sexual politics underlying their invention, the historical narratives that are erased, it is also reaffirming the place of Western History in the creation of computers. In other words, <em>The Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage</em>, innovative, restorative, and revisionist as it might be, still foregrounds a White, English, Heterosexual, Anglo-American past as the foundation for innovation, empowerment, and creativity. The story excludes because it does not include&#8211;though the footnotes do a good job of affirming expertise and telling us <em>how</em> to read the novel (but they are still open to skepticism!!!).</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll leave you with this, it&#8217;s on the back of many of the phones you carry with you: &#8220;Designed by Apple in California. Assembled in China.&#8221; </p>

<p>Think about how these two sentences, separated by the insertion of a period, fullstop, signal a politicized hierarchy (China assembles, they don&#8217;t invent, design, or even make) / California does all the brainwork. In so doing, these separated places (California&#8211;not USA??&#8211;and China (a country, not just the largest State in the Union)) are doing two different things; one has cache and is involved in creative thinking and the production of cultural capital; the other merely assembles what it has in front of it, mindlessly. California is a <em>place</em> of activity and thoughtfulness. Whereas China is a <em>country</em> of repetitive mindlessness. </p>

<p>Inherent here is the ambiguity as well: <em>what</em> is designed&#8211;the phone, the software, the graphics, the circuitry, the glass, the plastic? <em>What</em> is assembled&#8211;the phone, the software, the graphics, the circuitry, the glass, the plastic? How do we understand the differences and how do we place value on them? If something is only &#8220;designed&#8221; is it ever real? It would seem that assembly is essential. Without that action we can never use the design. So, which place performs the more important function? </p>

<p>All this noted, one fact remains: together, these two countries produce and make accessible to a large number of people the most arresting and game-changing piece of machinery in the last 25 years. </p>

<p>So, which of the places noted above, in the reading I just gave, is Lovelace and which is Babbage? </p>

<p>Is Lovelace more like California? How? Why? Why not? Give examples.<br/>
Is Babbage more like China? How? Why? Why not? Give examples.<br/>
Is Lovelace more like China? How? Why? Why not? Give examples.<br/>
Is Babbage more like California? How? Why? Why not? Give examples. </p>
