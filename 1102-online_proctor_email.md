Thanks for following up. You will need to write the final through a proctoring service in your area. You will need to set this up on your own and establish an appropriate proctor. I suggest looking at the Athabasca University page (http://registrar.athabascau.ca/exams/invignet.php) and then use that to find a proctor near you who can invigilate the exam. Please note that the Athabasca policies about conflict of interest and appropriate proctors apply in the case of English 1102.090 at Douglas College. 

The Athabasca University proctoring links are all for Canada. Given that you are in the U.S., I would suggest engaging a proctoring service closer to you. Depending on where you live, a local College or University will usually offer a proctoring service. 

Once you have set up the proctor, the next steps will be clearer and you can write the final exam in person wherever you are. It goes without saying that you should set this process in motion ASAP, especially if finding a proctor in your area will be difficult.
