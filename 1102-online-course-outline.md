Syllabus: ENGL 1102-090: Reading Literature and Culture  
Digital Culture  
Dr. David N. Wright / wrightd@douglascollege.ca	  

**Disclaimer:**

Please note that this section of English 1102 is a fully online class. This means that there are no face-to-face meetings, but students are expected to log into the course a minimum of 2 times each week and should plan to spend at least 3.5 hours online each week in course activities (excluding reading the assigned novels and preparing assignments). Students must have access to a computer and, usually, a high-speed internet connection to be able to take this class, as well as be proficient with word processing, attaching documents, and other computer applications. Please take note of the unique features and requirements of this course. It is your responsibility to keep up-to-date with what’s happening in the class to do all the required reading and other work.

If you are not a self-motivated student, you may want to consider whether an online course is the right choice for you. This type of course can sometimes be difficult for those who aren’t prepared to take on the responsibility for learning the course material on their own time and scheduling the required time to complete the work.  You will be expected to do a good deal of learning on your own.  I will guide you, but often you will be required to find your own way and report your findings without the benefit of my council.

We will be using the Blackboard Version 9 course management platform (LMS) for the course. Emails will be sent within the course using the course internal messages function and will not be sent to your external email address. This means you will need to check into the course regularly each week (daily is recommended) to check on whether you have any emails from your instructor or classmates. Emails will not be sent to external email addresses.

**Course Description:**

In this course, we will examine artistic (primarily literary) representations of digital culture. We'll look at texts that represent coders, hackers, and computers, analyzing how those texts reflect or interpret our digital world. In particular, we'll look at how digital culture reflects traditional literary themes such as gender, race, labour, anxiety, and gaming, among many others. The course will offer an opportunity to see how artistic production represents the structures of our digital lives. As we work to understand representations of digital culture, we'll pay attention to how digital culture reflects social attitudes, cultural practices, and political movements. The aim is to understand how the devices of literary interpretation--character, setting, theme, narrative--can help us dissect the underlying currents of an emerging digital environment.

8. Plagiarism--using the ideas or words of another--a published source, website, chat-room, forum thread, internet portal, social networking site, tutor, or friend--in your writing without proper acknowledgement--is a serious offence that will result in your work being forwarded to the Associate Dean, LLPA for assessment and may result in a note being placed in the student’s file, which could be grounds for expulsion. Plagiarism penalties apply to **any assessed component of this course** and I will show no pity toward examples of plagiarism. Ignorance is not an excuse.

**Explanations:**

**Essays:** The course will require two take-home formal essays. In order to pass--a grade of P--the course, students must submit both essays. Topics for the essays are listed below and a separate question sheet will be made available on the class website or by request. Take-home essays should be typed, double-spaced, in a legible 12pt font, with minimum 1 inch margins and be formatted as noted in the course policies above--in MLA style with a title, proper in-text citation and a work(s) cited page. They should be submitted via Email and include your name in the file name as noted in the policies above. 

For those of you unfamiliar with the requirements of an English course, please remember that good writing is imperative for a positive assessment. Essays should include a relevant thesis statement supported by exposition that is clear and logical. Errors in sentence structure, argumentative logic and grammar, spelling, etc., will affect your grade negatively. Take the time to proof-read your work for typos, formal problems and logic. Keep an extra copy of all essays (except those written in exam booklets). It is your responsibility to provide a copy of your essay--or other work--should it go missing.   

----

**General Grading Rubric for Essays:**

*A+*: The content exceeds expectations of the prompt. It is incredibly focused and coherently integrates examples with explanations or analysis. It demonstrates awareness of its own limitations or implications, and it considers multiple perspectives when appropriate. It reflects in-depth engagement with the selected text, and the argument is incredibly persuasive.

*A- through A*: The content exceeds expectations of the prompt. It is focused and coherently integrates examples with explanations or analysis. It demonstrates awareness of its own limitations or implications, and it considers multiple perspectives when appropriate. It reflects in-depth engagement with the selected text, and the argument is persuasive.

*B- through B+*: The content meets expectations of the prompt. It is focused and coherently integrates examples with explanations or analysis. It demonstrates some awareness of its own limitations or implications, and it considers multiple perspectives when appropriate. It reflects engagement with the selected text, and the argument is sound.

*C through C+*: The content meets some expectations of the prompt. It is somewhat focused and integrates some examples with explanations or analysis. It demonstrates minimal awareness of its own limitations or implications, and it considers few perspectives. It reflects engagement with the selected text; however, the argument is not as sound as it could be.

*C- through P*: The content does not meet expectations of the prompt. It is not focused, or it does not integrate examples with explanations or analysis. It does not demonstrate awareness of its own limitations or implications, or it does not consider multiple perspectives. It does not reflect engagement with the selected text, and the argument is not sound.

*F*: Serious errors in basic language use. Incomprehensible. The content is missing or falls extremely short of the word count or does not address any aspect of the prompt's expected outcomes.

----

**Exams (30% of your final mark -- 15% each):**

**Exams:** Exams will require a good knowledge of the texts assigned in the course and the literary terminology that might be applied to a reading of them. Questions will be a mix of short answer and essay questions that ask the student to demonstrate an acquired and applied knowledge of the texts and concepts covered in the course. In every instance, the emphasis is on the student’s ability to explain clearly and accurately, with a degree of originality, the major concepts of the course.

----

**In the Online Space (Or in the LMS (Blackboard)**

Comment Threads and Discussion: Comment threads and Weekly Discussions are designed to get you exercising the texts we will be reading together and the way those texts might be applied to help learn the basics of literary interpretation. The point of the discussion setting is to create a space where we can discuss limitations, successes, and failures. They are not a space to present perfected thoughts--leave that for essays and exams. It should go without saying, but you need to have done the reading to participate fully in the discussions. **All of it.** Carefully. You should arrive at the course discussion spaces ready to play. If you are not prepared, and are preventing others from getting the most out of a discussion, I will ask you to refrain from participating until you are ready to engage properly.

**Participation:**

Since conversations are essential to the quality of one's learning, we will work together to create an atmosphere premised on difference. College-level discourse does not shy away from sensitive issues, including questions of race, gender, class, sexuality, politics, and religion, and neither will we. There are going to be differences in opinions, beliefs, and interpretations when we read literature, question it, and engage history and culture. You need not agree with the arguments presented in discussions or with what your peers or I have to say. In fact, it is important to think critically and question course material. But please do so intelligently, without the assumption that everyone agrees with you or shares your experiences. Difference is central to creating a learning environment in which a variety of ideas can be exchanged and points of view can be explored. Ultimately, what is crucial to this course is that you are comfortable expressing yourself and your ideas. If, for whatever reason, you are not, then you should notify me immediately. 

**Expectations for Work Away From the Classroom:**

I expect that you will be spending anywhere from 5-8 hours each week working on the materials for the course outside the LMS or classroom setting, either through reading, reader response writing, or essay drafting (or all three). If you are doing less than that, you’re not meeting the expectations for the class and can expect the results that come with lack of effort and engagement.

----

**Trigger Warning:**

In this course, we will encounter descriptive scenes that some might find unsettling--drug abuse, murder, poverty, child abuse. If at any point you feel uncomfortable being present while the material is being discussed, please feel free to remove yourself from that discussion, either before that discussion happens or, if you are caught unaware, during the discussion. No explanation is needed. However, if the analysis of the course texts will be difficult enough to prevent your success in the course, please notify me; discussions between you and I remain private. Plot synopses of all the texts we will encounter are readily available on Wikipedia, feel free to consult the synopsis beforehand and decide if the content of this course is the right fit for you.

**Ethics Statement:** 

This course prioritizes the formal requirements of “academic writing” usually understood as proper citation, the logical development of persuasive claims, and a somewhat formal voice. You have an ethical responsibility to write at a level that reflects the absolute best of your abilities in the English language. Remember, your completed essay is a reflection of your effort. Your essays will be graded for the application of course content in the service of making a claim, grammar, vocabulary, argumentation, rhetorical style, organization, and for their attention to the rules of proper academic essay format. All of these components figure equally into your final grade.

**Peer Evaluators / Tutors:** 

While having others respond to your work outside of class can be helpful, if someone else does more than point out errors and problems and discuss corrections in a general way (if a friend, family member, or an individual solicited on-line rewrites your sentences, adds words that are not your own, or provides you with a thesis or structure for your essay) you are not learning to improve your work. Having others write all or part of your essay or assignments is plagiarism and academic dishonesty. If you are working with a tutor on your essays, you should inform me of that fact and be prepared to submit, if requested, all notes and drafts of your home essays so that I can see what kind of help you have received. Failure to do so will result in an F/0% on the assignment in question. 

**Statement of Responsibilities:** 

My responsibilities for this course are to introduce a wide range of examples and explanations that will illuminate the texts and guide your interpretation of them. I will also offer guidance on academic writing styles, and offer strategies for generating, organizing, and writing essays. If there is ever something you do not understand, please do not hesitate to raise questions. As well, feel free to Email me if you want clarifications, suggestions, or general guidance. However, be prepared with something to talk about, or some general ideas about your problem(s). I will not develop, write, proofread, etc., your paper for you. I encourage you to take advantage of my Email with questions should you have any problems, but I will not teach the course directly to individuals who do not participate fully in the online spaces for the course. 

---

**Explanation of Grading Procedures:** 

If you receive a grade you are unhappy with, or do not understand, you should make every effort to address it promptly. Do not let grades fester or take on undue gravity. I am more than willing to explain where you went wrong and give you plenty of pointers for improvement. If you do not attend to issues with your writing, you cannot expect to improve. I am never grading your work with an eye for cruelty. I am grading your work in order to show you where you stand amongst students who take--or have taken--an English literature course at Douglas College. As much as possible, try to manage your expectations where grades are concerned. The point of the course is to improve your writing. If your writing did not need improvement, or assessment in a college context, you would not be here. This course is difficult because it demands a level of writing that reflects college and university contexts, not the aptitude of your personal expression or comprehension. In this course, I am grading your writing and how you present the content of your essay. 

**E-Mail:**

With the exception of holidays and weekends, I will respond to your emails within twenty-four hours. Please maintain a sense of formality in your Emails to me. I have many students in many different courses. Please tell me what course you are in and what your name is when you Email me. 

**Learning Climate:**

Douglas College is committed to promoting, providing, and protecting a positive, supportive, and safe working and learning environment for all its members. Students and faculty members are expected to adhere to the [User Conduct Policy](https://www.douglascollege.ca/~/media/4310D1BD02AE4A74B9D0832D61FA18A1.ashx). Students should alert me immediately if they have any questions about this policy and its application, or if they have concerns about course proceedings or participants.

**How to Do Well in this Course:**

- Read the books before we discuss them. Otherwise, you will not be able to follow lectures or conversations in class. Plus, demonstrating you’ve read the book means you’ll likely do well on the final exam.
- Write while you read. For me this means annotating a text as I read it. You can annotate print and digital texts. (See me if you need ideas or resources.)
- Come to class with ideas and questions. Be curious. Seek connections not only between texts but also between this course and other courses you’re taking.
- Take notes during class meetings. A good portion of the exams will cover what we talk about in class. Students who take good notes not only understand but also retain the material better. They also do better on the exams than students who do not take notes.
- Let me know when you don’t follow what I’m saying. I find this stuff fascinating, but I will not always know what you want to investigate or learn more about. If you have questions, then please don't hesitate to ask them. There's no need to feel like an imposter in this course.
- Persuasive writing takes time. Before you submit an essay, consider writing and circulating drafts. Ask friends or peers to give your writing a gander. Come chat with me during office hours. Consider how your writing can extend and even complicate our class discussions. Also, avoid writing that is primarily descriptive. Push your work into an analysis of the assumptions, aesthetics, and ambiguity at work in literature.
- During class and in writing, be concrete when you comment on anyone's work (including the texts we're discussing). Quote it. Speak to specific gestures. And then respond with your own interpretations. When the work is by a peer, affirm their ideas (e.g., “I like how you…”).
- Use class meetings to share ideas, but also discuss what we’re reading outside of class. If you have a question, then ask me or your classmates. If you hear something you want to remember, then write it down for later reference. If you feel like we’re ignoring something important in class, then bring it to our attention. Consider forming reading and writing groups for the course.
