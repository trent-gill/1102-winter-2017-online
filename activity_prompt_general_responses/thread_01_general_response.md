General Comments about Activity Thread #1

First up, great job from most of you getting out there and completing the activity. It's great to see engagement like this and makes it easier for me to make the course material(s) relevant to the experiences you are having. Let's keep it going!

First up, the process for the discussion threads needs to be clarified. In the future, please do not start a new thread when you come to leave your response to the Activity Prompt. Instead, reply to whomever is the first one in the discussion or, if you are the first one, you can start the thread that others will add on to. As it is, the discussion thread is very fractured because we need to go in and out of each thread to comment; it looks less like a discussion and more like a bunch of answers to a quiz. I've created a short [tutorial](http://digitalcultureslab.ca/douglascollege-online1102/winter2017/tutorials/) (link up Friday!) to help those of you who need it see what I mean. 

Let's try to add to the thread rather than create new ones when we complete the next activity prompt. Nicole has already completed a response to [Activity Prompt #2](http://digitalcultureslab.ca/douglascollege-online1102/winter2017/activity-prompt-2/) and started a discussion thread, so everyone should hit "reply" on that and add their impressions for what came out of completing the activity or, how their activity diverged from Nicole's. Doing so will make for a more pleasant and consistent reading experience and hopefully open the discussion a bit so that we can drift away from prescriptively completing the questions I pose in the prompt and towards conversations that explore how we apply the activity prompt to our learning in the course. 

All that said, feel free to start a new thread if you have a new topic you want to introduce that relates to the Activity Prompt, but not in the way that the main thread is going--others can reply to your initial response and start new conversations that way. Bottom line, there shouldn't be more than 3-5 thread topics per week (but I'm flexible, depending on what we need!) and everyone should "reply" to the first entry. **This does not mean that there is extra pressure if you go first!!! You're just the one who is starting the thread.** If it gets to pressure-packed, or the same people are going first all the time, I will start the thread that we'll all chime in on.

Phew, okay, now to the content of the responses themselves. I'll be making some direct comments randomly to people, so make sure you check in on what I have said to others and see if this helps or hinders your understanding of how we might understand literary terminology and how our expectations shape how we imagine the content of the text or how the text ["makes meaning"](http://digitalcultureslab.ca/douglascollege-online1102/winter2017/lecture-module-2/).

Generally, what we want to recognize by visiting a bookstore is the assumptions we bring to bear on texts (like bookstores!) and how our expectations guide our experience of setting (and, by extension, character but we're not quite there yet!). For instance, things commonly found in "Big Box" bookstores such as Indigo, Chapters, or Barnes and Noble, things such as coffee, cook books and cooking utensils, diaries, day planners, American Girl dolls, pillows, candles, and everything in-between, tend to skew toward female expectations. This is interesting when we think about some of our cultural assumptions about male and female reading habits--who does all the reading in *Harry Potter* books (clue: it's not the boys!)? Point is, the setting (bookstore) is organized in a way that reflects the assumptions about the characters (customers) who will engage with it. They are not set up [arbitrarily](https://www.google.ca/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=define%20arbitrary). There is a calculated effort to make the bookstore reflective of the *experience* of reading, sometimes an experience had by a particular gender. There is a calculated effort to have the bookstore *mean* the *experience of reading*, particularly all the secondary elements we associated with reading: coffee, blankets, curling up, the home, writing in a diary, being "literary" or "bookish." We need to approach reading texts with the same kind of awareness about how the text sets up an experience, or guides our imagination, toys with our expectations, or appeals to our biases. 

Extending from this, you might also want to think about how bookstores have a narrative attached to them. When we visit an IKEA or other large showroom-type store, we are often forced to "follow a yellow line" to get to the end. We need to walk through displays, around corners, through the store in its entirety before we get to what we want. Often we are guided, rather than being allowed to find our own way. The first floor of a Chapters or Indigo bookstore, for instance, features few actual books--we often have to go upstairs for those. When we walk in, we are distracted by all the other stuff the store wants to sell us *on top of* the books. The way the store is organized then, its narrative, tells us a lot about what it expects us to spend the most time on, care most about, and pay attention to. Texts work the same way: they are organized to highlight, emote, foreshadow, etc. (To practice narrative interpretation, you might start reading the retail outlets you visit to figure out what their narrative is--what are they emphasizing and why, how are they organized and why, who is where and why, how does the store "tell a story" and why that story?) 

A lot of you spoke to the employees in a bookstore. What I was trying to draw out in this area of the prompt was to encourage an awareness of what "bookish" might mean and how we represent that bookishness. If you walked into a bookstore and all the employees were 260-pound, 6-foot-4-inch rugby players wearing shorts, you'd think that was weird. But, the employees in a bookstore put us at ease because they *represent* bookishness. On the other hand, if you were to take these "bookish" people and put them in a sporting goods store, that would be weird--bring on the rugby players! Again, our expectations help the book make meaning and they also distract us from underlying meanings that might be revealed later on--this is how suspense works!

When you walk into a bookstore, you are not expecting to see a new car showroom, or furniture for sale. When you walk into a used bookstore, your expectations are different than they would be for a new book bookstore. Sometimes, even the city will change your expectations for things: you expect to find cool used bookstores in "literary" capitals such as New York, London, San Francisco. In countries such a Korea, China, or Bangladesh, bookstores might have quite different looks and cater to different expectations. What all these places share though is that they are bookstores. We all generally understand what a bookstore is and what makes it a bookstore. 

Our job as readers is to get into the details of how a text represents its bookstore so we can talk about differences, similarities, assumptions--the particulars of the representation. We need to ask, to paraphrase Mr. Penumbra: "what is it we seek in these shelves?"

So, when we read *Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore*, we are bringing these expectations about bookstores with us to the text. What we imagine is a combination of what the words on the page tell us and what we know about bookstores. Genre works in this way too: when we open a novel, we expect a novel. And, we have a very specific set of expectations that should be met by that novel. If they aren't met then we get confused. 

To summarize: setting helps us determine how we understand characters, symbols, and what we imagine in our heads. As the online lecture for Module #2 suggests, these literary terms interact with each other and with our expectations in order to make meaning. The important takeaway here is to recognize our expectations for reading--that we bring with us baggage that helps us understand the text and that we rely on the details of setting, character, etc., to help us make meaning and imagine--or animate--the text.

Now, what we need to do more of in the discussion threads is turn our attention to how the activity prompt might inform our reading of the text or, how the text makes meaning. We're always more interested in how our activities, blog posts, and essays help us understand how the text makes meaning or what it means or what it represents. 

We should ask then, what are some specific words--yes, words--that help shape how we image Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore? (No italics because I mean the actual store; the setting, not the novel.) How do those words match, trigger, or diverge from, our expectations for a bookstore? How does our experience of a bookstore in real life match, trigger, or diverge from Mr. Penumbra's? How is the Mr. Penumbra's Bookstore symbolic? And symbolic of what? Which parts of a bookstore does it emphasize, why? What does it leave out? Why?

There's admittedly a lot think about here. Don't worry. A video lecture is coming that will shed a little more light on what I am talking about. As well, in the next module we'll do some practical exercises to get you going on close reading and interpretation. 

In the meantime, feel free to reply to this thread with your questions, comments, or ignorance--all of which are welcome equally!
