"Douglas Coupland does a brilliant job using geographical setting in JPod to showcase characteristics, character parameters and help me relate to the locations various characters visit."



"Culture, race and religion are also significant influences of geographical setting in JPod, which I believe Douglas Coupland added intentionally because of the widely known multicultural communities throughout Canada especially lower mainland of British Columbia."



"Are readers at a disadvantage if we are not familiar with the setting in a novel? The setting of a story is arguably one of the most important components of a novel. Setting includes the time and geographic location in which the story takes place. The placement of characters in a specific geographic setting allows the author to attach certain attributes to those characters based on the area in which they reside. Douglas Coupland’s novel, JPod, mainly takes place in the Lower Mainland. In our day-to-day lives, we tend to attach certain stereotypes to people we meet based on the neighbourhood in which they reside."




"The setting in a text can represent a lot in a story beyond the general imagery of a characters surroundings, such as the tone, mood, or even culture. Robin Sloan goes on to express the important battle of old versus new technology with the use of different geographic locations mentioned in the novel, Mr. Penumbra’s 24 Hour Book Store. Specifically, Google headquarters is used to symbolize new world technology, due to our perceived ideas of Google as a brand, and the general geographic location of Google headquarters itself."




"Robin Sloan in his book called Mr. Penumbra’s 24-hour bookstore was not the exception of the rule, his structure represents many of the tools in different ways.  For instance, the setting of the text is constantly engaging the reader with the general idea of the book, “old vs new”. The setting and the relationship between the characters reinforces the fact that millennials share a different lifestyle than baby boomers."




"In Robin Sloan’s book “ Mr. Penumbra’s 24 Hour Bookstore”, Sloan’s use of geographic settings really symbolizes different stages of the story. As the story progresses on, the setting changes and symbolizes different things and values."



"Essay 1, Mr.Penumbra’s 24-Hour BookstoreThe narrative of Mr.Penumbra’s 24-Hour Bookstore is a fascinating book of the accounts that take place to a San Franciscan young man (Clay) in his journey to figure out the secrets of his new job. Many characters enter into the story that are all relevant to the mysteries being pursued by Clay. I found that none were just ‘passing by’ in a sense that there were no ‘wasted characters’."



"The interpretation of an environment can be influenced whether you are optimistic or pessimistic. Interpretation also becomes influenced when reading through the perception of another character. "



"A dichotomy between progression and degradation is portrayed through Ethan’s interpretation of China’s urban landscape, demonstrating the negative and harmful impacts of a consumerist nation on the environment and society.    Throughout Ethan’s descriptions of China, and more specifically of its largest city Shanghai, are mentions of the country’s industrial landscape and intermittent wealth, both suggesting the country’s expanding consumerism..."
   
   
"It can be said that this Silicon Valley is also home to the start of author Robin Sloan’s literary career. The Google headquarters is a geographical setting that very well acts as a metaphor for the main idea of this novel.
   The author introduces Google through Kat. She quotes “Google’s like a baby compared to that” (p.53). A googler herself saying this very much stresses upon the idea that the technology has still a long way to go till it could figure out all that has been written. This idea is further brought into our view when Raj says “did you know that ninety-five percent of the internet was only created in the last five years? But we know that when it comes to all human knowledge, the ratio is just opposite”."
   
   
   
"Indeed, the interaction between Clannon and Mr. Penumbra, must be as any other 20 years old guy would interact with a 70-year-old.'


"In the case of JPod, Vancouver at the turn of the millennium becomes a grounding force in the fictionalized account of the comings and goings of a small group of Vancouver area video game designers and their loves ones.  Accurately including Vancouver’s landscape and communities within the greater area gives a sense of realness to a story that often veers into the unreal."
