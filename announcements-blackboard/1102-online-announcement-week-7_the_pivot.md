Hi Everyone,

A little checkup here heading into week 7 and pivoting into the rest of the course. 

Consult the [course schedule and readings](http://digitalcultureslab.ca/douglascollege-online1102/winter2017/course-schedule-and-readings-full/) for this week and next. The readings include *Agrippa* and several other poems by Ishac Bertram, Elizabeth Bishop, and E. E. Cummings as well as definitional segments on poetic form, Narrative Poetry, and Epic Poetry. All the readings are available online--through the class website--for this week and next. We'll head back into novels with *Ready Player One* in a few weeks.   

There is a Reader Response Blog Post for this week, but the lecture module for this week will not be posted until Thursday. And, there is **no Activity Prompt for this week**. Concentrate on getting your essay in by Wednesday (not later than 11:59, by email (wrightd@douglascollege.ca or the course messages function in Blackboard). That said, make sure you spend some quality time with the Stuart Hall reading "Encoding / Decoding," which we'll be looking at in more depth this week and next.

We're also "pivoting" slightly in the next few weeks into an analysis of poetry and poetic form. Nothing much changes with the shift in texts, so approach the poems as you would approach a novel for now, looking at aspects of character, setting, symbol, narrative, etc., and make sure you do the contextual readings around poetry, which will help you get a handle on how these poems tie-in with what we've already been reading.  

In the meantime, I'll have more to say about the exam next week in a later announcement and post (there will be a review and preview). As well, everyone should have their grades for the first round of Reader Response Blog Posts by the end of this week. This week is a good opportunity to catch up on your reading and to probe around the Blackboard site for the course and look at the areas where myself and others have responded or contributed. Think of this week as an opportunity to reset and reorient yourself in the course, preparing for the final push in the second half of the course. 

The other "pivot" we're making heading into Week 8 is a turn to focus more forcefully on themes and thematic analysis. The last two modules--week 5 and 6--both started this turn and we'll be continuing a move into more contextual thematic analysis from here on. The important thing to remember as we do this is not to abandon what we have learned in the course so far. The literary terminology is essential for understanding and writing about themes. The course content builds on previous content, so make sure you are bringing forward the components of literary study (the terms!) we have been discussing up until now.
