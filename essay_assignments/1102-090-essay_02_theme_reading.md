**Task:** After choosing **one** of the four questions below, write an essay that interprets a particular facet of **either** *Ready Player One* **or** *Agrippa* **or** *The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage*  and makes a claim in support of something you think is significant about what the text represents (or how it "makes meaning").

**Notes:** This writing assignment emphasizes close reading, without need to read beyond the novel. You should focus your interpretation on how the text represents a theme. Avoid trying to address the *entire* text, or multiple characters, and do not spend a great deal of time recounting plot events. You should show your audience how an interpretation of specific **things** in the text works and what's significant about those **things** when we try to understand how the text represents--or defines--a theme. You should not present a book review or plot synopsis that serves only to demonstrate you have read the book. Focus on how one of the contexts below is represented in a **single** character, symbol, metaphor, or event in the text, and which can be evidenced through specific references to the text. Then, speak to how that representation--as illustrated by your interpretation of the text--diverges from--or affirms--our expectations, assumptions, or biases about a theme. Finally, suggest how your interpretation--as evidenced by the text--is significant for our understanding of the text and what it represents--or defines--thematically. 

Remember that what I expect from you is that you have something to say about how the text represents and defines themes. Do not write for any expectation other than that you have a willing reader who wants to engage with your interpretation of the text at hand. Please do not write for what you think I expect. Write what *you* think. Taking the above instructions into account, I want to read about your perspective, not the perspective you think I want from you. **Your audience is NOT me. Your audience is a group of people who have read the text and who are curious about what you think is significant about its theme.** 

While format, style, word count, and other formal elements of the essay count toward your assessment in this assignment, the majority of your grade comes from the soundness and presentation of your content. Pay attention to how the essay demonstrates good sentence structure, word choice, paragraphing, logic, coherence, clarity, cohesion, and thoughtfulness. An essay that is perfect formally, but demonstrates poor sentence structure, incoherent word choice, poor paragraph structure, poor logic, lack of clarity, rushed and unresolved claims will be graded far, far lower than an essay that is sub-par formally but reflects solid sentence structure, clear syntax, word choices, paragraphing, and logic, precise focus, coupled with thoughtful, resolved, and assertive claims speaking to what's signifiant about the text. Obviously, formatting is important, but, for example, a terrible essay that meets the word count will not pass; an excellent essay that does not meet the word count will pass. 

No matter which question you answer, write about how the theme (identity, power, reality, history) operates in the text. In other words, how and why does the text represent that theme the way it does: what is its effect on how a reader might interpret a character, symbol, setting, or POV? Remember to nest your answer in specific references or examples from the text and include a claim/thesis that offers an interpretation of the prompts below. 

**Special Note:** Being a comic, *The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage* presents a somewhat special case for textual evidence. When referring to the comic, you should include the image to which you are referring in the text of your essay as you would a quote from a written text. The image should be cited consistently, so that I can find it, according to the MLA stylesheet. You should also make sure to offer an interpretation of **both** the words and the image(s). You cannot appropriately address the prompts below using *The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage* without referencing all the specifics inherent in the text. Avoid addressing only the images or only the text in *The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage* **where both are present**. When no words are present, or no image(s) present, in your textual example, it might offer an opportunity to discuss the implications of such absences in the text.

1) **Identity**: What is significant about how identity operates in the text? 

How does the theme of identity operate in the chosen text and why is this approach to identity (in the text) compelling or unique? As you write, consider briefly describing the general characteristics of the text (e.g., plot, genre, characterization, setting, and style) but focus on interpreting one or two key passages in detail to illustrate your claim. 

Below are some questions to help you get started. These are *potential* avenues for discussion. Please do not treat these questions as needing to be answered in your paper. You could write a paper that addresses or responds to none of the questions below, only to the prompt. At most, you should respond to one or maybe two of the questions below and remember that you must assert what's significant for our interpretation of the text in your answer to these questions. These questions are here to help you get started or think about what you have to do. They are not meant to be [prescriptive](https://www.google.ca/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=prescriptive).

* How do individuals represent themselves in the text and why? 
* What role do assumptions about people play in the text and why are the assumptions significant? 
* How do topics such as race, cultural capital, gender, sexual orientation, sexism get reflected in identities? (If you answer this question, pick only one of the above topics to discuss--narrow the focus!) 
* What is normal in the text? Why are certain perspectives and positions treated as the default or norm? 
* How do the characters' voices represent identities and why is this significant?
* How do characters switch codes or morph their behaviours across situations? How do they identify, and when?

2) **Reality**: What is significant about how reality is represented in the text? 

How is reality represented in the chosen text and why is this approach to representing reality (in the text) compelling or unique? As you write, consider briefly describing the general characteristics of the text (e.g., plot, genre, characterization, setting, and style) but focus on interpreting one or two key passages in detail to illustrate your claim. Remember this question **is not** asking you about how "realistic" the text is, but how it chooses to represent  different or parallel realities.

Below are some questions to help you get started. These are *potential* avenues for discussion. Please do not treat these questions as needing to be answered in your paper. You could write a paper that addresses or responds to none of the questions below, only to the prompt.

They are not meant to be [prescriptive](https://www.google.ca/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=prescriptive).

* What are the characteristics of reality and why are those characteristics important to character, setting, story, or POV?
* How do racism, patriarchy, colonialism, ableism, homophobia, xenophobia, transphobia, classism, weightism, and/or sexism influence the perception of reality for characters?  
* What assumptions does the text make about reality and why are they significant? 
* What is understood as "real" and "unreal" in the text? When and why is the distinction significant?

* What do characters assume about each other? 
* What perspectives and positions are treated as the default or norm?

* Consider how and why the text chooses to represent particular details--names, participants, dates, locations, descriptions, documentation, controversies, and memories. What's significant about these details? How and why might they be biased? Who is making the decisions about what details to include?
* What are the histories and events upon which your selected text relies? 
* To which documents or records do characters refer and why? 
* What events are remembered or mentioned often in the text? 
* How is the history coded? With what or whom is it associated? 
* Which events haunt the text or its characters? 
* Which events are represented, revised, or illustrated by the text? 
* When does the text read more like non-fiction than fiction? Which historical events are used as material for that non-fiction? 
* Which events do we assume actually happened? Which events appear fabricated? Why are such distinctions significant? 
* When do you trust the text's account of history or reality? When don't you? Why? 
* How do you draw boundaries between fiction and history? To what effects on interpretation?
